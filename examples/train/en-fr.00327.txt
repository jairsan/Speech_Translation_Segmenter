madam president i voted in favour of this compromise because it makes sense that we have sustainable use of pesticides
i think the real problem is that there are such different rules across member states some countries apply training and education of operators in a very strict way and therefore have good sustainable use of pesticides but not all countries do so
i think this piece of legislation will make it appropriate that we have higher standards across the european union
that is good both for those who operate sprays and for those who come into contact with them
i think we are talking about a very sensible package here so i was very happy to support it and i congratulate the rapporteur
