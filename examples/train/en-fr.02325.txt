president barroso i know that the european trade union confederation has already raised very strong objections about the detailed interference by the commission in the greek and irish labour markets riding roughshod over collective bargaining and social dialogue
your new annual growth survey promises more of the same
your officials are calling for a revision of indexation clauses and pay deals the promotion of flexible work a review of unemployment benefits and a reduction of over-protection of workers
do you not agree that the commission should be looking to promote social dialogue and collective bargaining rather than undermining it
and as the issue of pay is specifically excluded from the social chapter of the treaty what legal basis is the commission using to interfere in national collective bargaining systems
also the doubling of the fiscal consolidation effort called for in the survey is going to choke off any possibility of achieving the twenty twenty process goals
what is your answer to that
