mr president tax and taxing is an extremely important topic when we talk about development policies
it is a crucial topic for policy coherence for development because without a proper tax system without proper policies on tax havens we will never be coherent in our development policies and at the moment we are not
therefore i very much welcome this report and i hope that tomorrow you the members of this house will not water it down
we need to complement the commission communication which has serious shortcomings for example by not addressing problems within the oecd and by not addressing the impact of tax competition on tax revenues
if we want to comply with the lisbon treaty if we want our development policies to be coherent we need to take action now and i ask you to support this report in full
