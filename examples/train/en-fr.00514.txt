mr president some of the amendments you ruled inadmissible were also ruled inadmissible by the chair of the committee on the environment public health and food safety under the recast procedures
this parliament has no right to introduce legislation
its chance of influence is in amending legislation put before us
it seems that in the way we have interpreted the recast procedures we have castrated ourselves
could you inform the president that if this parliament is to demonstrate its true virility we need to review these
