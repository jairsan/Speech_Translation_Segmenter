mr president many in the house have today congratulated the irish people on their good sense in rejecting the appeals of nigel farage and the uk independence party and voting overwhelmingly in favour of the lisbon treaty
members should perhaps also commiserate with the british people because we have to put up with mr farage on a daily basis
he calls a two-to-one majority in ireland a victory for bully boys
i am afraid his words are all too typical of a man who uses distortions and deceit and sometimes downright lies about the european union
all too often those words are unchallenged by journalists
however hyperbole can turn to insanity
now he is comparing the campaign in ireland with the brutality of the latest elections in zimbabwe
he describes the treaty that gives every member state the right to withdraw from the union as an end of independence
nevertheless we should be compassionate
parliament has a medical service
mr president i invite you to ask the men in white coats to offer their services to our colleague
nonsense about europe may pour from his lips but at least they can help ensure that he does not choke on it
