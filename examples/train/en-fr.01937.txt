madam president there was a curious lack of passion i thought about the commissioner's opening remarks
of course the commission is the guardian of the treaty and all its principles but frankly you would hardly have guessed that from what she said
in this debate we have heard examples from across europe of bad practice
in my country the uk we have excessive media ownership by news international by rupert murdoch
if a politician seeks power they do not tend to rock the boat by challenging that too much
and as for italy when a prime minister owns a substantial part of the media if that is not abuse of the principles of the treaty then what is
how can we condemn bad practice elsewhere if we do not ensure that our own practices are as good as they possibly can be
now of course there are limits to the commission's powers to its legal competence
but commissioner you are not a bureaucrat you are a leader you have a voice and this is a time when that voice can be raised to embarrass people to force change to act for freedom
