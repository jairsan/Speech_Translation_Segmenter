mr president the ecall system in motor vehicles is a major advance in assisting emergency services to get to the scene of an accident as quickly as possible
the device identifies the exact location of the accident so that the medical police and fire services are able to get to the scene as quickly as possible
this is particularly important in rural and isolated areas and particularly in the case of single car accidents
ecall is now standard equipment in all new cars in many eu countries
unfortunately it is not available in my own country ireland where we still have an unacceptably high level of fatal accidents
i believe that the system should be mandatory in all member states
this is about saving lives and this device certainly saves lives
that is the reason i am calling on the commission to insist that all member states insist that this device be available in all new motor vehicles
