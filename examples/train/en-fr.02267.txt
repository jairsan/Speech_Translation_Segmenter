madam president thank you for using my full name
i think we should celebrate the fact that nato's lisbon summit has strengthened protection for our peace and democracy in direct contrast to the treaty of lisbon which is already doing quite the opposite
but nato is threatened by the savage cuts being imposed on european armed forces
these are deeply dangerous
it is unforgiveable that the uk government is slashing spending to below the two base level every nato member is meant to honour
it is a false economy too because defence spending brings good jobs
today the british harrier jet is removed from service
this month we lost the carrier hms ark royal prematurely with the loss of six zero dedicated personnel
the usa cannot be expected to carry this burden with less and less contribution from us
we should be under no illusion that the americans could pull out of nato as top british general dannatt has warned and leave us to an emboldened russian bear still prepared to launch cyber attacks against estonia and to systematically probe british sea and air defences in disturbing echoes of the cold war
