mr president given that improving energy efficiency is the most effective way of cutting co emissions and given that the public sector according to the two thousand and six directive is supposed to play an exemplary role in this matter i am disappointed that there have been no energy-efficiency improvements in connection with the major repairs carried out on the strasbourg parliament building
i would like to know where the building's energy performance certificate is displayed
furthermore it is entirely inconsistent for the authorities to have allowed meps in the corridors of parliament to sign a life-size model of a bull in support of the written declaration against bullfighting but not allowed them to sign a banner in support of the written declaration calling for a single seat for the european parliament
a single seat is how we could best cut our energy use and save eur two hundred million a year
