first of all the substantive issue that we have addressed is that freedom of expression in all its forms is not only a fundamental human right but the cornerstone of all democratic societies
it is not negotiable
at the same time it is also clear that there is information be it private commercial or legal which by its very nature is sensitive and cannot be accessible to the wider public
data protection is also anchored in fundamental rights
all our member states have rules that protect data and some kinds of sensitive information for the sake of the public and this is our position in terms of freedom of expression and data protection
regarding accusations against a specific person i am not a tribunal
also the commission is not supposed to make comments on specific accusations against specific individuals because the commission is not and is not to supposed be a tribunal and does not make presumptions as to the culpability of a specific individual
