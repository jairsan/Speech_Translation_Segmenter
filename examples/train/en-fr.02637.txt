madam president i am very pleased that the commissioner reminded us that the overwhelming amount of movement in the region has been in north africa itself
the unhcr estimates that over four hundred zero people have already left libya
that is something that having listened to the debate on the procedures directive earlier some of our members would do well to remember the majority of people are moving within north africa
we very much welcome the support given to the unhcr and other bodies in assisting those displaced
a lot of concern however has been voiced at the pressure on malta and lampedusa and quite rightly
it is significant but not equivalent to what is happening in tunisia and egypt
however there is growing concern about what is happening to minors unaccompanied or separated at arrival
there is concern that they are not being properly supported or identified
we hope that the commission will look at their situation and at the situation of those others considered particularly vulnerable at this point
we also welcome the willingness to consider using the temporary protection directive
could the commissioner please outline what criteria she will be using in making that assessment as to whether to bring forward a recommendation
