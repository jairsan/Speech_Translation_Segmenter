mr president the summit in córdoba will be a test for all of us european institutions and member states
it should demonstrate clear european commitment to considering a fully fledged political and operational strategy that would in addressing roma issues go beyond obvious human rights perspectives fundamental as they are towards real economic and social inclusion
we need an integrated strategy policy and an action plan cutting across all areas relevant to economic and social belonging
much has been done and achieved but without any doubt there is still a long journey ahead of us
we need the commission parliament the member states but also as minister lópez garrido said local and regional authorities working hand in hand
we expect from the commission a clear allocation of the responsibilities for this matter and effective coordination between all relevant services
we expect the eur five million pilot project currently implemented by the commission to pave the way for efficient and effective solutions in the areas that matter most early childhood education and economic inclusion and provide progress on policy learning and evaluation
we appreciate the commission efforts especially those by the regional policy dg and we encourage the commission to further enhance local and regional involvement in practical action strengthening the economic inclusion of roma society
in parliament many colleagues across the political groups have already demonstrated their involvement but our duty is to put much greater political power into this issue
roma inclusion would give us a chance to move forward towards making the european labour market truly inclusive
it would give us a chance to move forward in addressing european demographic challenges
so let me conclude by saying that we must treat the córdoba summit as a last call for real inclusion of the roma
