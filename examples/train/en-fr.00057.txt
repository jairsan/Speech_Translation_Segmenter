mr president my political group supports the commission's white paper on the health strategy
in particular we support the focus on prevention education and encouraging healthier lifestyles
planning to protect our citizens from health threats and pandemics and aiming to reduce health inequalities across the eu are very important
we need new guidelines on cancer screening a directive on organ donation improved surveillance mechanisms to respond to health threats and improved exchange of best practice
but with regard to e-health i should sound a note of caution
this is an area where we need to draw up precise rules defining a clear framework
it should be clear that it should not exclude those who are not internet-literate and should not replace a visit to consult the doctor
this said i can see many advantages but we must also be aware of the potential perils
however what health policy also needs at eu level is clear focus
in my work as shadow rapporteur on this report i have detected a real sense that there are too many different working groups and work streams expert groups and task forces many of which have been set up as presidencies pet projects or because of pressures from members of this house or from other interest groups
i believe the eu has a lot of value to add in the field of health but that resources should be properly focused and provide value for money
i would urge colleagues to vote for my amendment two calling for the commission to launch a review of current work streams
i would also urge colleagues to support my amendments on protecting our citizens health from dangers at work
i would like to ask the commission to respond in particular to my amendments one and six regarding exposure to substances toxic for reproduction
in the forthcoming proposals for review of the carcinogens directive it is vital that substances toxic for reproduction are included
i understand that the commission has made a u-turn on this and would be grateful if the commission would explain its position
