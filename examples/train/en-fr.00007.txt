mr president among the projects that the eu has encouraged is the single electricity market on the island of ireland
can the commission explain why it is not working for consumers in northern ireland and why instead of stability and price savings we have seen a massive fifty-two hike since january of this year and an ever-widening gap with prices prevailing in the rest of the united kingdom where in the same period the price rise was twenty-nine
big in itself but a lot less than fifty-two
will the commission investigate the failure of this scheme to deliver the promise of minister dodds when he launched it of efficiency savings and enhanced competition to help minimise the wholesale cost of electricity with the vast bulk of the benefits he said going to the consumer
for my constituents less than a year on that rings very hollow indeed
in particular will the commission investigate the contribution to the non-delivery of the single electricity market of the failure adequately to address the dominance of the esb in the southern market and the resulting lack of competition which of course is the imperative to success in any single electricity market
