madam president several paragraphs and sections of the florenz report especially paragraph one hundred and ninety relate to agriculture's contribution to climate change
while low or conservation tillage is an option in most eu states and has economic as well as climate change benefits and deserves far more support in my view the agricultural debate and research concentrate largely on the methane and nitrous oxide contributions of ruminant livestock
while progress is being made i do not support member states having to meet their non-trading sectors targets for emissions reductions by the compulsory reduction of europe's cattle herds
let us not forget that what we do not produce here in europe we will import
one kilo of beef produced in brazil results in six times the carbon dioxide emissions of one kilo of beef produced in ireland
