mr president the draft anti-homosexuality bill which was introduced in the ugandan parliament raises serious human rights issues
the protection of the human rights of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people is a priority for the eu
i fully share the european parliament's concerns about the situation in uganda but also in other countries where punitive and discriminatory legislation against lgbt people has been adopted or is under consideration
the commission considers that the criminalisation of homosexuality as foreseen in the draft bill goes against obligations under the united nations human rights convention to which uganda is a party and by which it consequently has to abide
the draft bill also goes against the united nations declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity
the eu presidency and the eu head of mission in uganda raised this issue with the ugandan government on several occasions during meetings with the president prime minister minister of foreign affairs and minister of justice in formal political dialogue meetings and also with the uganda human rights commission
the publication by the newspaper on two october twenty ten of a list with the photographs and names and addresses of people who were identified as gay together with the headline hang them was an outrageous act that put the lives of these people at risk and we fully condemn it
the european union delegation continues to monitor the situation closely together with the eu member states missions represented in uganda as well as with partner countries like norway and the united states and the office of the high commissioner for human rights
the matter has also been addressed in the technical human rights working group which is a forum for developing partners in uganda to discuss monitor coordinate and take concrete action in human rights-related cases
the commission intends to keep raising its concerns in relation to the draft anti-homosexuality bill and to other actions to persecute lgbt people in uganda on every occasion
the commission will continue to support local human rights organisations in their efforts to change attitudes in the country and to improve the legal situation for lgbt people
