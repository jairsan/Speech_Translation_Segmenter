madam president we have on many occasions discussed the problem of gaza and the economic blockade that is maintained by israel and the misery it causes but we do not often have a chance to celebrate some of the good things that are coming out of gaza
during the course of the summer two world records were set by children there
seven thousand children broke the world record for bouncing basketballs and a similar number of children broke the world record for flying kites
this is all thanks to unrwa and the summer camp programme they have organised there for young children giving them something to do in circumstances which are very dire indeed
i hope the house will congratulate the children on an achievement and be reminded that half the population of gaza is under eighteen
they have not voted for anyone
they are not responsible for any of the problems or the conflicts of that area
they are just looking for a normal life and for some hopes and aspirations for the future
i also thank unrwa and its organisation together with all the palestinians who work for it for making these summer camps possible
