mr president this is a real crisis
twenty-three people are dead over two zero have been affected the vegetable markets are in turmoil with prices on the floor and it is estimated that producers are losing eur three hundred million a day
relations between germany and spain are strained to say the least and yet three weeks into this crisis we still have no idea of where the source of this contamination has come from
commissioner dalli i want assurance from you here today that absolutely every effort is being made to trace where the source of this e coli outbreak has come from because until we trace the source we cannot start the process of rebuilding consumer confidence
secondly i want you to spell out what actions you intend to take once we get over this crisis to stabilise the market and rebuild consumer confidence
thirdly we do have to hear from you what the commission intends to do to try and compensate farmers who through no fault of their own have seen their markets destroyed and are unable to sell their produce
fourthly i want an assurance from the commission that a transparent independent investigation will be set up to establish the facts of what went wrong
it is only once we have the facts that we can take action to plug any gaps in food safety law
