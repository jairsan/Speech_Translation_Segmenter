i was very reassured by yesterday's commitment by prime minister papandreou to cut public deficits and reduce the government's debt through permanent expenditure cuts and revenue increases
we believe the current budget for twenty ten that is now being discussed in the greek parliament and prime minister papandreou's statements are steps in the right direction
i have been following the situation very closely with this government and with the previous government namely the question of public finances
we were also very impressed by the candid presentation made by the prime minister of greece in the last european council
he is fully aware of the problem and he has shown us his determination to address it
greece will submit to the commission in the course of january an updated stability programme as foreseen in the stability and growth pact
i trust that this programme will include concrete measures to strengthen fiscal adjustment in twenty ten and to ensure lasting consolidation of public finances
naturally the commission will continue to monitor very closely the macroeconomic and fiscal situation and the implementation of the measures in greece
having said this i do not consider it appropriate at this stage to elaborate on possible scenarios
we believe that greece is now taking appropriate measures and that we should support greece in the enforcement of those measures
