madam president this report starts from a false assumption the assumption that the eu knows best when it comes to employment policy
many of my constituents would profoundly disagree they would rather that the eu were kept well away from anything to do with employment policy
i believe that my country should withdraw from the eu's social chapter
it is more than a little ironic that the eu seeks to pass on its wisdom on employment policy to the member states whilst at the same time it is responsible for huge amounts of red tape and regulation that have constricted so many businesses in my region and across europe and caused an awful lot of the unemployment that it now seeks to cure
the european social model is outdated it is destructive it prevents job creation and it acts against entrepreneurship
the best thing would be for the eu to keep its nose out of the member states employment policy and produce less red tape and less regulation
that is the best thing that we could do to create more jobs in the economy
