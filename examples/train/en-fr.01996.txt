mr president this report very wisely recognised the role of farmers in conserving biodiversity and their contribution to good environmental practices in general
as we discuss the imminent reform of the common agricultural policy one of the main arguments in the debate is beginning to focus on the responsibility of farmers in this regard and how they should be compensated for these environmental benefits or public goods which they deliver
i do think that we have to change our approach to this issue
i want to see farmers encouraged to engage in agri-environmental measures rather than being subject to stringent cross-compliance rules
in this regard i am an advocate of the carrot rather than the stick
ms de lange's report mentions the idea of an extra direct top-up payment which i believe is a very interesting idea and would encourage farmers to do more to help protect the environment
i do not agree with those who say we need a soil directive
i do not believe we need that
we have enough tools in the box
we need to take up the challenges facing us at the present time in this area and i have no doubt we will be able to do that in the reforms
