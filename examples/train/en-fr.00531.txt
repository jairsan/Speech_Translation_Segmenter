mr president i would like to reiterate on the record in relation to this most important maritime package recital three of the review of the eu-ets directive which was passed by an overwhelming majority
this directive deals with our carbon dioxide emission reduction targets and the timetable for the same
recital three states that a ll sectors of the economy should contribute to achieving these emission reductions including international maritime shipping and aviation
in the event that no international agreement including international maritime emissions in its reduction targets through the imo has been approved by member states and or no such agreement through the unfccc has been approved by thirty-one december twenty eleven the commission should make a proposal to include international maritime emissions according to harmonised modalities in the community reduction commitment with the aim of its entry into force by twenty thirteen
such a proposal should minimise any negative impact on eu competitiveness taking into account the potential environmental benefits
comments please commissioner
