mr president i voted for this report because the safety of children who are online is a real concern for me
it is also an issue that is raised by many of my west midlands constituents
i know that many parents and teachers are increasingly anxious about children accessing material which is inappropriate and potentially dangerous
the growth of the internet into a powerful worldwide medium has increased the dangers to youngsters throughout the world
recent research in the uk has revealed that as many as one in ten children who use computer chatrooms have been approached over the internet by paedophiles
in acknowledging that the internet offers a world of entertainment opportunity and knowledge to children we must however also put in place measures to keep them safe on the internet
i believe it is our responsibility to protect children from harmful material and some of those who conduct online lines
the european parliament has a vital role to play in reducing the availability of inappropriate and illegal materials and increasing public awareness of online dangers
i therefore welcome this report and eu efforts to safeguard our children
children should be able to benefit from all the opportunities this technology offers without fear of those who would cause them harm
