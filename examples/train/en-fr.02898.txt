mr president the road to democracy is often a slow and tortuous one
some countries move quicker than others and we see that with the countries of the former soviet union who are now our valid colleagues here in the european parliament
others countries move somewhat slower maybe ukraine is an example of that
nevertheless it is important to recognise that it has made progress but must go further
in particular to establish true democracy it needs first of all to promote civil society secondly end state control particularly over ngos thirdly have a truly independent judiciary and fourthly have a free and strong opposition
you cannot have proper democracy without having a free strong and vibrant opposition
we in the european union must use every means to encourage ukraine to go the full circle and establish true democracy
it has made progress but it needs to go a bit further
