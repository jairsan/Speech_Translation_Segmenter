madam president the new fundamental law of hungary one would say a far too controversial text for a constitution has been rushed through the hungarian parliament after only one month of public consultations
hungarian civil society and the venice commission have expressed serious concerns regarding the duration and transparency of the process
sometimes those questioning this text have been accused of doing so for purely political reasons
one expected the new hungarian constitution twenty years after the fall of the communist regime and at a time when hungary holds the presidency of the european union to entirely reflect the most cherished values in the eu
are these only political values
i admit that as a liberal i am worried about government eroding civil liberties and democratic control
i am worried about legislation turning a blind eye to diversity and i am convinced that not all hungarian citizens recognise themselves in the conservative image portrayed by the constitution
how could i remain indifferent about a text on pluralism and the concentration of power in regulatory authorities such as those set out in the still fresh hungarian media law
we should all worry about democracy when a ruling party passes laws that cement its power well beyond the end of its term and limits the relevance of future elections and about political leaders going as far as writing or amending fundamental laws that fit only their political credo or economic policies
and yes i am worried about the spill-over of these hungarian patterns
my own country's leaders have been inspired by these actions and some recent amendments to our romanian constitution seem to be copied and pasted
they will not be approved but the attempt is there
european institutions must not be shy at such times
we need to strive to make all european citizens feel not worried but reassured that our values are at the core of our legislation and are there to stay
