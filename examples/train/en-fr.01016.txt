mr president as the first irish person to speak in this debate may i thank colleagues for their kind comments about the irish electorate
i also note the people who have been thanked here so far
i would like to point out that two people who played a stalwart part in this campaign in the yes vote and put their countries interest before their own party political interests mr enda kenny td leader of fine gael and mr eamon gilmore td leader of the labour party have not been thanked
they did more than anybody else selflessly to ensure that this campaign was carried and i want that acknowledged on the record here today
the lisbon treaty process in ireland demonstrates that when we make the effort to bring people with us they are prepared to respond to leadership
the european project remains the best hope for the people of europe and elsewhere for a peaceful and prosperous future
we cannot assume that people will appreciate its benefits
we have to be as open and as inclusive as possible while explaining these benefits to them
enlargement has not blunted the project
rather it has enabled us to let others share in its benefits
there is indeed unity in diversity
some people in ireland were unsure of the contents of the treaty others were concerned about abortion being forced on a member state about neutrality about the loss of the commissioner and about the potential for the country to lose control over its own direct taxation policy
the irish parliament through a special committee identified the concerns of the people following the first referendum and the government got guarantees on these matters from our partners and crucially the change in relation to the future composition of the commission
that was democracy in action at every level
the reason the irish parliament had a right and a duty to do what they did is that the sovereign people of ireland gave them that right and duty
from the high turnout and overwhelming yes vote it is clear that the democratic will of the people was served
mr president i support what you said about concerns among some of our peoples
let me now raise one issue which i feel needs to be raised
some people in ireland and elsewhere believe that the eu is becoming a cold place for christianity in particular and religion in general
i have to say that i personally have experienced disrespect from people here who see themselves as fair-minded and liberal but who are anything but that when it comes to trying to see things from the point of view of people who have religious belief
i respect those who do not have religious belief but i fully expect them to reciprocate that respect
that is what the whole eu project is about
i repeat unity in diversity
the second irish referendum shows what can be achieved when we are truly inclusive
i put these words out there for those who have ears to hear and for posterity
let us now move to complete the ratification and then to deliver on the promises that lisbon contains of greater democracy and transparency a coherent role in the world applying the same tolerant and inclusive principles in our dealings with other regions of the world especially the poorest parts as we must apply internally
