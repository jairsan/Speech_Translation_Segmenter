mr president i would like to move an oral amendment which would become paragraph seven a new
it is signalled on the voting list and my understanding is that it has the support of the political groups co-signing this resolution
it becomes the consequence of paragraph seven
so the new paragraph seven a would read hence calls once again on the commission to develop a comprehensive european strategy for roma inclusion as the instrument for combating social exclusion and discrimination of roma in europe
