mr president i was elected to this house twenty-five years ago
this is probably the most important debate in which i have taken part
madam commissioner i hope you listened very carefully to the foreign affairs committee last night and to this parliament today
i hope you may reply in your debate to say unlike president-in-office schwarzenberg that there is moral power that the european union may exert on the aggressor on this particular occasion
the israeli people are a just and honourable people who have suffered miserably throughout the centuries in this continent
they will understand your recommendation to the council of ministers now that the eu should withdraw any contact with the israeli authorities until they stop the bombing
