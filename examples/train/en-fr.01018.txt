mr president i would appeal to those who do not like the outcome of the irish referendum to stop questioning the democratic procedures in ireland
ireland is a democratic state
it is an independent democratic state
the parliament of the irish republic made a decision to hold a referendum that referendum has been held
it was supported by ninety-five of the elected representatives in the irish parliament
so please you can have your criticisms of the european union but you have no right to question the democracy of my state
