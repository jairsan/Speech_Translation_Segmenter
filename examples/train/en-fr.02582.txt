mr president my group is happy to support the treaty amendment proposed by the member states
we do so because we want the euro to survive and the countries that use it to prosper
we in the united kingdom are glad that we are not part of the euro but we wish you well
while we support the treaty amendment however we do not support this report because what we have here is a wish list of unnecessary changes dreamt up at the last minute
it really is unfortunate that the parliament is behaving in this manner
such posturing is all the more bewildering given that we will vote on this opinion only hours before the european council formally agrees the treaty change
does anyone here really believe that the council is listening to us
if the parliament wants to be taken seriously we must stop grandstanding and instead start delivering for the citizens of our member states
