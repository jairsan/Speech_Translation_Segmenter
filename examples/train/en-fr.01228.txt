mr president nicaragua remains one of the poorest countries in the americas
the fact that president daniel ortega has failed to improve his country's situation despite myriad socialist utopian promises upon taking office would suggest that nicaragua needs a change of leadership now
the country's constitution permits heads of state to serve only one term sometimes a wise policy in a region prone to instability but ortega is once again showing his contempt for parliamentary democracy and the rule of law by abusing the constitutional court's powers
in this respect he is no different from his fellow leftist hugo ch√°vez of venezuela
both men have made their names denouncing but they themselves are turning into of the left and as such represent a genuine threat to regional democratic stability especially given the chaos in nearby honduras
daniel ortega has failed his people and his country many times over
if we truly believe in democracy and freedom we cannot ignore the plight of the citizens of nicaragua
