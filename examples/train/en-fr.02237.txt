madam president human trafficking is quite rightly a pejorative term because it describes a disgusting practice
human beings disproportionately women are treated as though they were commodities even livestock to be transported used and often abused
however the term is used too narrowly
very little legal economic migration is truly voluntary
most people other things remaining equal would prefer to remain with their own people in their own countries
they migrate for economic enrichment or because economic forces have removed their means of maintaining their livelihoods
migration is the by-product of global capitalism that sees people not as human beings but as factors of production that are expendable
economic migration is as much a form of human trafficking as illicit migration organised by criminal networks
the human traffickers are the governments that quite deliberately unleash supposedly blind economic forces in the service of global capitalism
economies should exist to serve the people
people do not exist to serve economic forces
