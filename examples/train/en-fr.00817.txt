mr president i have never been a great fan of the people's mujahedin of iran whose philosophical origins are islamist-marxist which is a contradiction in terms and they were of course for many years under the protection of saddam hussein the butcher of baghdad whom they supported militarily
nevertheless in recent years they have reformed and have given valuable information to the west about human rights violations in iran and the geographical location of iran's secret uranium enrichment facilities
it was therefore questionable if they should have remained on the eu banned terrorist list
what is unquestionable in my view is that the residents of camp ashraf deserve legal protection in iraq from its government and the allied forces and do not deserve deportation to iran where they face almost certain torture and possible execution
