mr president a society consumed by rights is a give-me give-me <unk> which has lost its balance
it is this which drives the report's demand for equality between regularly married couples and homosexual relationships
the natural order is man and woman
we pervert it when we demand equality for its very antithesis
unfashionable as it may be i unashamedly declare that the unnatural partnership between same-sex couples is not something to which i as a legislator wish to consent
are my rights to espouse that position any less than those of the people who demand the opposite
in view of the intolerant climate in which part of this debate was held it would seem so
i disagree with this aspect of this report
if that subjects me to ridicule then so be it
i would rather stand for what i think is right than to applaud that which is wrong
