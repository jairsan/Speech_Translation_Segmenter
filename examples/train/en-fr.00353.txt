mr president once again i express my appreciation and admiration for the efficient handling of this file by parliament
it is a result of a remarkably quick consensus
as has already been mentioned this is not yet the end of the story much still needs to be done at level two
member states will also have the task of transposing this new set of rules level one and level two altogether before the summer of twenty eleven
arrangements for cooperation between national supervisors will have to be put in place
these are key to the good functioning of the management company passport
i can assure you that the commission will play its role in order to facilitate this progress and to put these badly needed changes to work in the eu fund industry
