thank you for your comprehensive reply commissioner
you spoke about the responsibility of member states
can you specify the progress being made in simplifying the basis of calculation of eligible costs and making greater use of lump-sum payments particularly in the area of the structural funds
my second question relates to the consultation document itself and the largely negative response to agriculture
if we look at the consultation document it lists tomorrow's challenges as diversity scientific and technical progress the knowledge economy climate change energy security but it does not mention food security
so is the negative response to agriculture unduly influenced by the document itself
