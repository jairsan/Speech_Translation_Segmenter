mr president i will be brief
i think there are three particular points that i would like to refer to
firstly honourable members have quite rightly talked about the importance of fundamental rights and i think we would all agree that there of course is a significant role in this for the european court of justice who amongst other things will make sure that rights are respected in terms of what the council or the commission does
but i take the point very well
the second point i wanted to make was this issue of good cooperation
the previous president called upon both me and mrs wallstr√∂m to be very clear about the importance that they attach to our role and approach in dealing with parliament
i was asked specifically what information
at this stage i do not know
i think one of the things that i have to do as i set out in this new role is work with parliament which i will do to look at what it is
how we cooperate effectively and what information is included bearing in mind indeed what was said about what can we put in the public domain or not
i will be extremely mindful of that for all the reasons that members of parliament would expect me to be
the third and final thing i would say is about legal certainty
i spent many hours taking the lisbon treaty through a parliament so at one time i knew the treaty extremely well
the interpretation of article seventy-five of course is how you refer back to article sixty-seven and the relevance of that within the context and so the legal advice we have got is to try and seek to clarify where indeed this now fits
the advice we have is clear
members of parliament of course are at liberty to contest that but i think it is very important that wherever we arrive in this there is legal certainty
it is extremely important as the lisbon treaty comes into effect
it is extremely important to me as i work out how to do the role that i have been honoured to be given
it is extremely important that we reach a conclusion on this
for my part i think we have the answer in terms of certainty
i do understand parliament's concern i do understand the need to nevertheless cooperate fully
