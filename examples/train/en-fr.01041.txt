mr president last month i informed the plenary of the discovery of the remains of cypriot soldiers who during the invasion of nineteen seventy-four were photographed surrendering to the turkish army alive and well
in a new development the european court of human rights has found turkey guilty of cruel and inhumane behaviour towards the relatives of missing soldiers of that period by failing to investigate and inform the relatives about their fate
turkey was ordered to pay compensation in this regard
i call again on this parliament to urge the turkish army to provide its records to the un committee on missing persons for the resolution of this humanitarian issue
