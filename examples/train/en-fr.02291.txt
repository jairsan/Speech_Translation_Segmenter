mr president inflicting physical pain is against human dignity
caning is a gross violation of human rights
it is against the right not to be tortured but also against the right not to be subject to inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment
in malaysia over ten zero people suffer from this form of corporal punishment every year
accounts show that the pain is so great that victims often lose consciousness
reports show that a number of officers carrying out the punishment are eager to accept bribes to spare the victims
therefore in addition to gross human rights violations we have government officials committing a crime by taking advantage of people's suffering
i call upon the commission and the council as well as on the malay government to urgently work for an immediate moratorium on the practice of caning followed by its elimination from the law
beating up people and whipping people on behalf of the government must stop
