mr president i may have changed my seat here to the ecr group this week but i have not changed my perspective on the european union
when it comes to schengen it has been the ecr view that this is generally a matter for schengen area members to decide including switzerland of course which is in schengen but not in the european union
but the closure of the border by france to italian trains and danish demands to mend schengen shows it is in crisis
pragmatism dictates that the implications of bulgaria and romania joining are profound for those way beyond the schengen area
a leaky border will mean that many illegal entrants destined for the uk can reach calais without hindrance for example and bulgaria has not complied with its obligations on organised crime
in summary this proposal is simply a border too far
