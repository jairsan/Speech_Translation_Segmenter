mr president i welcome the reduction of the financial reporting burden on smes
smaller companies are not simply downsized versions of large corporations so some reporting required of large companies is not relevant at all
other parts create an excessive drain on resources do not fit with the realities of the huge variety of smaller companies that we have in europe and in consequence do not serve the public interest
unnecessary reporting does a lot more harm than good so i am glad to be rid of some
let us keep up the good work
however the part of the final text of the report that my group and others disagree with is that on correlation tables
the commission wanted correlation tables on transposition to be mandatory even in this little directive and that is our position
the council will not agree because it says this is an unnecessary burden
my answer to that is that it should not be
we must find a way to make transposition of eu legislation accessible
there is an enormous democratic deficit
member states are responsible but europe gets blamed
there are some similarities here with the criticism that has been made against the lisbon treaty because it is unreadable as a stand-alone document
however there should be even more of an outcry from the public because day after day this is just what many member state governments are doing to their citizens and businesses in their transpositions
let us be clear
this is something that is not an eu malaise
it is a member state government malaise and it must end
