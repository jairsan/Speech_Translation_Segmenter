mr president i want to talk about respect for the rule of law by intelligence services
a ruling today by the uk court of appeal has blasted open the british government's attempt at secrecy
it has confirmed as parliament said three years ago the shocking truth that uk secret services did collude in the torture of british resident and rendition victim binyan mohamed
what does the council think of that total breach of article six of the eu treaty and the torture convention
in two thousand and six i led the mep delegation from our temporary committee on extraordinary rendition and torture to london
the then uk defence secretary geoffrey hoon wasted half the meeting lambasting me just for saying that we were enquiring into uk complicity
he owes me and more importantly the british and european public an apology
four things now need to happen in the uk a full independent inquiry into uk complicity in war-on-terror abuses during the years the uk labour government acted as a bush poodle a rapid police investigation and if necessary prosecutions for breach of the torture convention disclosure of what instructions were given to uk intelligence officers and if they were told to keep silent in the face of torture and full parliamentary accountability which we do not have in the uk for the intelligence services
