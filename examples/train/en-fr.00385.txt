mr president in july nineteen ninety-five close to eight zero men and boys were murdered and disappeared in srebrenica
the highest courts of international law have called this massacre by its proper name genocide
while continuing our pursuit of justice against the perpetrators i think it is right that we should remember the victims and express our compassion for their families
i therefore join you today in supporting this initiative to recognise eleven july as the day of the commemoration of the srebrenica genocide
srebrenica stands as a symbol of horror and inconsolable grief
remembrance is as painful as it is necessary
it is necessary because we cannot and we must not forget
it is necessary to counter the selective remembrance of those who remain in denial until this day about what really took place
recognition of what happened in july nineteen ninety-five is fundamental to reconciliation within bosnia and herzegovina and in the regional process
proclaiming eleven july as the european commemorative day for the victims of srebrenica should therefore be a further step towards reconciliation within bosnia and herzegovina and the region
i think it would be an opportunity to send a message not just of respect and memory but also of hope for the future a future within the european union built on reconciliation allowing wounds to heal over time
but recognition alone is not sufficient
justice is equally essential
i think it is important that all perpetrators of those atrocities be brought to justice be prosecuted and pay for the crimes that they have committed
it is therefore unacceptable after so many years that general ratko <unk> remains at large
the commission fully supports the work of the international criminal tribunal for yugoslavia the icty
we welcome bosnia and herzegovina's cooperation with the icty and its handling of cases transferred by the tribunal to local jurisdiction
we as the commission use every opportunity to encourage the authorities to continue their efforts and ensure that all crimes are duly prosecuted
in addition to the justice of the courts we can offer a second form of justice for the victims and that is a better future for their loved ones who survived
this is at the heart of our eu's efforts in the western balkans
we want the countries of the region to move towards a common european future
we want to see a prosperous bosnia and herzegovina within a stable regional context where borders matter less and trust among neighbours is restored
we know this will be a long journey but if the history of the european union and its enlargement tells us anything then it is that this journey is worthwhile for all concerned
we cannot travel the road to the european union for bosnia and herzegovina
it will itself have to meet the conditions and overcome its internal challenges by its own means but we can help
we will help and we want this country to succeed as the triumph of the survivors over those who had other designs
