mr president i support the cercas package
i think the bottom line on this debate is that human beings are social beings they are not machines and they should not be treated as such in the workplace
a person applying to an employer for a job has no freedom to refuse to sign a form saying they are denying themselves the right to the coverage of the working time directive so to argue that abolishing the opt-out is in some way an attack on freedom is not right it is actually an attack on the abuse of an employee who needs to work in order to live
in my view the current opt-out in use in fourteen member states is an attack on the idea of building europe on the basis of common decent working and living conditions and we must not allow that to happen
