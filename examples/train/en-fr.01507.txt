mr president global capitalism moves people around the world some legally some illegally as though they were simply expendable facts of production
it moves goods and even services around the world in a bid to undercut the prices of its latest victim closing factories farms and offices and throwing workers on the scrapheap
it moves money around the world closing workplaces in europe and the developed world and opening them in places where wage rates are a fraction of the cost
the european union's embrace of global capitalism is an embrace that will smother us all
whenever there is an economic crisis politicians line up to denounce protectionism
however it is only protectionism that will enable us to rebuild our manufacturing bases and guarantee our peoples their livelihoods
economies exist or should exist to serve our peoples
we do not exist to serve economic forces
there is no way in which europe can compete with the third world without becoming part of it and it is happening already
