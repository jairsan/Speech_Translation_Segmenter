mr president i should like to thank the interpreters for staying around because they did not have the option that mr beazley took a long time ago of going for lunch
i should explain that being in a big group is not everything it seems
it is very difficult to get speaking time in some of the key debates if you are not in agreement with the big group's line without either dramatically compromising your position or kissing backside in endless mind-numbingly boring meetings and that is why for people like me explanations of vote are very important
i suppose in general terms i should be welcoming the small business act or indeed any attempt to recognise the needs of small business
in fact it was bad regulation when i was running my own small business that got me into politics in the first place just trying to change one particular thing
however i am pretty sure that any regulation that comes from this place will certainly be creating more small businesses
alas they tend to be big businesses at the moment which when you add a lot of european regulation gradually turn into small businesses employing smaller numbers of people because they reduce their turnover because of that regulation and move jobs from our continent
we in this house have to be very careful that we encourage individuals to start up new businesses and do not encourage jobs to move continents because we are regulating jobs out of existence
