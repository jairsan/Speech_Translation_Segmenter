mr president as i hear discussions on ways to screw more money out of the little people in the name of climate change i am struck by two things
the first is how no one talks about global warming anymore
even the most out-of-touch meps have clearly realised that expos√©s of fraudulent pseudoscience and record cold winters across the globe have made the public rightly very sceptical about all the deceitful propaganda about drowning polar bears
the second is the car park beneath us porches mercedes bmws suvs a showroom of gas-guzzling luxury from the people who tut-tut in disapproval at many white vans and plot to make working lives even harder with speed limiters and financial penalties all for a dogma based on discredited statistics pedalled by a clique of bought and paid-for academics funded and hyped by super-rich vested interests in the green industrial complex al gore prince charles shell and goldman sachs all of whom stand to steal a fortune from the taxes harvested through wind factory subsidies and carbon trading
while i appreciate the efforts of some meps to blunt the worst excesses of this co hysteria the plain truth is that anyone who even gives credence to the threadbare hoax of man-made global warming is a collaborator with the deadliest scam in history
yes deadly because it is not only robbing ordinary people and de-industrialising the west it is also right now starving to death hundreds of thousands of the world's poorest children as food crops are replaced by taxpayer-subsidised biofuels
but it is boosting profits for monsanto and giving meps all expenses paid trips to palm oil plantations in malaysia so that is all right is it not
no it is not particularly as it is diverting attention from the real crisis not that we are releasing carbon dioxide from fossil fuels but that we are beginning to run low on the oil which powers our civilisation
every day wasted talking about limiting emissions of nature's most important fertiliser is a day lost in the struggle to sustain more and more people on less and less energy
if it was not such a tragedy it would be a farce
