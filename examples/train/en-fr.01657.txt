mr president today we know better than we did a week ago that jet-free skies cost a lot
the cost to airlines goes beyond their lost revenues
other industries are affected though there are also industries benefiting from the situation
what matters is also the fact that this new disaster has hit the already very fragile european economy facing the need for fiscal consolidation
i would like to raise two issues
the first is related to state aid
offering airlines state aid in compensation for the losses has a precedent in the bail out offered to american airlines after nine eleven
the european commission also offers fast-track procedures to state aid which is appreciated
but my question to the commission is whether we know the expected size of this new burden for national budgets suffering from huge deficits and debts and facing the challenge of fiscal consolidation
is state aid through national budgets the best solution
are any other options being considered by the european commission
the second issue is related to the european union's capacity to manage crises
we hear that during the first few days there was no consultation or coordination amongst relevant national authorities in a situation covering eighty of european air space
i can assure you commissioner that you can be totally independent and still coordinate
we might also hear soon that coordination would have allowed us to design and implement a better solution so in my view this is the time to move forward on eu crisis management
we clearly see that disasters that affect our citizens can also occur outside the eu territory in the european economic area or even outside the eea
my question to the commission is how will it use this disaster to enhance the european union crisis management capacity
i can assure you that we in the european parliament will support all your efforts to make us more effective and more efficient in crisis management
