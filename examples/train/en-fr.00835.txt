mr president i was given a mandate by the house to enter into negotiations with the other institutions on this important dossier
sadly i have to report that the negotiations have not been productive and therefore i am recommending to the house today that we do not vote and that we refer the decision on this important dossier to the next parliament when i expect the commission to produce a new proposal in the autumn of this year
