i understand very well the strength of feeling
this is a very important industry and i agree completely with david martin who has studied the detail of the deal with south korea
there is no doubt that we export far more clothing to korea than they do to us so there are real opportunities in the market
it is absolutely right that in thinking about everything we do on trade we need to be mindful of the impact on industries and that is exactly what we do
i would be more than happy to continue this dialogue and to provide more information about how we approach this because i agree completely with the view that we have to support our industries through this economic recession be mindful of the poverty and deprivation that can occur and give new trading opportunities that will actually help boost those economies and those sectors
that is precisely what we are seeking to do
