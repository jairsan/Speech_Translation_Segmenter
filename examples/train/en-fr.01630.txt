madam president i thank mrs <unk> for her very positive evaluation of the approach to the blacklist
the commission is convinced that the existing measures already provide for a very high level of information and rights to the public for flights within and outside the european union
the list of airlines banned within the european union is made widely available to the public on the internet and by targeted information actions
the commission liaises closely with european and international travel agent associations each time the list is updated
this allows them to be in the best possible position to aid the passengers
national civil aviation authorities and airports in the territory of member states are obliged to bring the eu list to the attention of passengers both via their websites and where relevant on their premises as well
the list provides useful information to people wishing to travel outside the european union in order for them to avoid travelling with these airlines
the list has no extra-territorial effect it does not apply outside the european union
hence the regulation establishes passengers rights to know the identity of every airline they fly with throughout their trip
the contracting carrier or travel agent or tour operator is required to inform passengers when making a reservation of the identity of the air carrier or carriers effectively operating the flight
the passenger must also be kept informed of any change of operating carrier either at check-in or at the latest when boarding
the regulation also gives passengers the right to reimbursement or re-routing if a carrier with which a booking has been made is subsequently added to the list resulting in cancellation of the flight concerned
different sources of information are used to monitor and assess the compliance of operators with international safety standards namely the safety audits carried out by the international civil aviation organisation the information provided by competent authorities of third countries the information provided by the european aviation safety agency in the framework of its inspections and investigations within the european union or technical missions outside the european union the results of the ramp checks carried out on aircraft or air carriers at eu airports in the framework of the safety assessment of foreign aircraft programme according to the requirements of the relevant eu rules and finally substantiated accident-related information stemming from accident or serious incident investigation reports
i should also mention that the european commission does not at this stage have a comprehensive list of the countries which have similar legislation but several states the republic of korea bahrain and the kingdom of saudi arabia apply the same restrictions as those defined in the european list
i can confirm that the commission is ready to work with parliament to really improve this blacklist legislation but it provides for much-needed safety in the air
