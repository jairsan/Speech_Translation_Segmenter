mr president today we have voted on the addition of new textiles and fibres and labelling-related matters
from the outset of this textile report i have been of the opinion that parliament should keep to the scope of the proposal as it was originally designated and that the extension of this scope was not compatible with the aim of simplification for putting a new fibre on the market
i have concerns about the provision of a review clause which will ask the commission to investigate the possible introduction of a number of labelling requirements which have little added value and would place unacceptable burdens on businesses especially small and medium-sized enterprises
this includes the harmonisation of size labelling social economic labelling and most worryingly a radio frequency identification tag which would increase costs for business and prices for the consumer
nonetheless from this report i feel that some of the provisions in this regulation will make a difference will improve the application process for business and enhance consumer protection especially on the labelling of animal-derived products
but we need to be mindful that we are legislating for the real world not making a wish list for an ideal world and that parliament should stick to its areas of competence in future
