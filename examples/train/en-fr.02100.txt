mr president the osce we are told is about advancing political and media freedom and human rights
mr chastel can i ask you then how you reconcile this with giving kazakhstan the chairmanship of the osce this year and the prestige of a major summit in its capital astana in december
are you aware that political rights in kazakhstan are cynically repressed media freedom is obstructed and human rights are routinely crushed
trade union and social activists are routinely thrown in jail on trumped-up charges
on a delegation visit to kazakhstan in september i received conclusive evidence of the most brutal treatment in prisons
yet two weeks ago commission president barroso rolled out the red carpet for the man responsible for those atrocities president nazarbayev with not a single word of criticism
why mr chastel
is it about iron and steel deals
the osce summit in kazakhstan should be cancelled forthwith if you are serious about standing up with the brave fighters for human democratic political workers and social rights in kazakhstan
