mr president i support the direction of the eu twenty twenty strategy particularly at this time of economic crisis and would urge that the eu focus on europe's existing comparative economic and competitive advantages and use all tools and resources available particularly in the area of r d to create real eu added value
i would seek for us to prioritise the completion of the single market for services and goods and to take an ambitious approach in creating a single market for innovative research
there should be wide encouragement of research and development both in universities and in private enterprises in europe so that we can be at the forefront of new sustainable industry and technologies
we must however remain vigilant against legislation that serves to hinder these developmental processes
we need to improve the link between private sector and academic research and work to facilitate the transfer of knowledge into job- and wealth-creating enterprises
as well as improving the availability of finance for innovation we need to ensure a reduced administrative burden particularly for smes and micro-entities
following sme-friendly procurement policies and allowing smes to participate in public private partnerships will be a start
an eu twenty twenty strategy focused on innovation in areas of existing expertise
