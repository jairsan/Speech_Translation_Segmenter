mr president china is an economic capitalist wonder but it is essentially a brutal one-party communist state
one of the more unpleasant facts is the forced re-education through labour camps or laogais to which millions of dissenters or political opponents from uighurs to falun gong practitioners and in the past of course tiananmen square protesters and their relatives are sent
in these camps there are horrendous albeit unproven allegations of organ harvesting for transplant purposes among prisoners about to be executed
it is a fact of course that china does execute thousands of its citizens yearly for various reasons from major capital crimes something we might find understandable to economic sabotage and even pimping
there is another issue which i raised in the past with commissioner mandelson which is the worry that forced labour camps may be producing goods
this is an allegation
one particular thing cited was rubber boots which somehow find their way onto the eu markets
i have some sympathy with the commission because identifying this or proving it has so far been impossible
