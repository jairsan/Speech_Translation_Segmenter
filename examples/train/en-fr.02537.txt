thank you commissioner for your answer
just three short questions and i hope you will be in a position to answer them
do you envisage ccctb as being voluntary
secondly do you envisage any circumstances in which domestic courts might lose their jurisdiction in tax matters if whatever decision they take impacts on yields in another member state
and finally i expect at this stage some formula has been arrived at for the apportionment of tax that is payable in the different member states
has any impact analysis been done by the commission on winners and losers and by that i mean winners and losers in financial terms under whatever formula you have already come up with
