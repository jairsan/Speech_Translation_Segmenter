in two thousand and six and early two thousand and seven the commission carried out an in-depth assessment of water scarcity and droughts in the european union
following this assessment the commission presented an initial set of policy options to increase water efficiency and water savings in a communication from the commission on addressing the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the european union
that was published in july two thousand and seven
seven policy options were identified for tackling water scarcity and drought issues putting the right price tag on water allocating water and water-related funding more efficiently improving drought risk management considering additional water supply infrastructures fostering water-efficient technologies and practices fostering the emergence of a water-saving culture in europe and how to improve knowledge and data collection
these were the seven elements
based on information from member states and on its own research the commission prepares annual follow-up reports that assess the implementation of these policy options throughout the european union
the commission is also implementing the white paper adapting to climate change towards a european framework for action
a further communication on mainstreaming adaptation and mitigation into the key eu policies is foreseen next year
furthermore the commission intends to launch by twenty twelve a blueprint for europe's waters which will be based on a review of the implementation of the water framework directive a review of the water scarcity and droughts policy and a review of the vulnerability of water resources to climate change
in order to prepare this blueprint the commission is launching a number of activities including a pilot project on the development of prevention activities to halt desertification in europe and an integrated assessment study of the vulnerability of european water resources to climate change and adaptation measures
droughts and desertification are also addressed by measures through sectoral policies such as rural development under the common agricultural policy and through cohesion policy
