mr president in the week when there is the resumption of direct peace talks and on the day which marks the beginning of the jewish new year and i wish to all jews in europe and in the world i deeply regret that the israeli knesset still intends to impose onerous and unacceptable reporting restrictions on all human rights organisations in receipt of foreign funds including funds from the european union
we have heard from the ngos affected both in our middle east working group and in parliament's human rights subcommittee that they undertake bona fide human rights work but that they are being intimidated and harassed by accusations of political bias
such restrictions on international aid for human rights ngos exist in countries including burma tunisia and rwanda
they should not be introduced in a country like israel and they are contrary to israel's obligations to support freedom of association under the conventions of the international labour organisation
there are too few voices for peace and human rights on both sides of the conflict in the middle east
those who do speak out are often overwhelmed by others who seek the path of violence
pluralistic democratic societies operating in conditions of peace and stability cherish civil society even when its message may sometimes be difficult
as george orwell said freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
