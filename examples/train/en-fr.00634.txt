madam president small enterprises play an essential part in creating cohesion in the eu and the extension of microcredit will underpin smes economic recovery
the committee on legal affairs recognises that establishing a firm can be a daunting process
the eu needs to do more by providing proper legal advice on setting up a business
one way to do this would be to establish a european network of lawyers prepared to give advice on micro-business start-ups initially on a basis
urgent efforts are needed to tackle the regulatory burden on micro-businesses and to make micro-finance institutions as accessible as possible
we need this type of legislation more than ever but legislation on its own is not enough
the commission has to make sure this is transformed into real action that can be felt at the ground level immediately because this report is not just about entrepreneurship microcredit also delivers social cohesion and it encourages people to take ownership of their lives and their potential
my congratulations to all the rapporteurs
