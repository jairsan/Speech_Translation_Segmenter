as i have said on a previous occasion in this house i stand before you as one keen to see a europe of cooperating nations
i have consistently opposed the federalism of the lisbon treaty and the ceding of powers from nation states
the result of the second referendum in the irish republic on the lisbon treaty changes nothing for the united kingdom
a document harmful to british national interests on two october two thousand and nine is equally as harmful on two october twenty ten
ratification in poland will not change that ratification in the czech republic will not change that the date of the uk general election will not change that and therefore i want to use this opportunity in this house to call for the british people to be given a referendum just as each and every european nation should be on the full and complete text of the lisbon treaty
