madam president for the past thirty years food prices have been both low and stable
now the united nations fao has warned that rising energy costs growing world population greater wealth and climate change are about to present huge challenges to the world food system and to the cost of food
this will have two important consequences on european governments
first the rising cost of food and energy hits the very poorest families hardest
second at a time when europeans most need a period of price stability while the economy recovers rising food prices will fuel inflation
in the short term the temptation will be to import cheaper food and to expect the food and farming industry to absorb the greater cost
neither route would be wise
over-reliance on imported food would dangerously expose consumers to price volatility and over-pressuring the farming sector which already faces steep cost increases and depressed margins would endanger productive capacity
we need to invest in the common agricultural policy
technology will be the key and now is the right time to do this
