mr barroso i am disappointed
it is question time and a yes or a no would have been easier but never mind
whether it is mr blair or not the fact is he will not be democratically elected you yourself have not been democratically elected in fact doesn t this rather sum up the whole eu
isn t it a rather wonderful organisation for giving retired clapped-out ex-premiers some real executive power
you could have democratised the eu with this treaty
you chose not to
does national democracy matter or is the european union in your opinion a greater good
