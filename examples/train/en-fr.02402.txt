mr president let me concentrate on paragraph ninety of this report which states that competition in agricultural production is a precondition for lower prices for consumers in eu countries
a bit of it is true but i am afraid it misses the point completely
we are having a debate among ourselves and in particular groups in this parliament about what is happening to the agricultural markets and why there is not fair transmission of the final price that we as consumers pay for food to those who produce the food
it is a very serious problem at a time when we are reforming agricultural policy threatening to cut the budget for agriculture and not looking at the imperfections in this marketplace
so the report should say much more about that
the commission is urged to look at competition in the agro-industrial sector yes please and look at it too in the retail sector but then stop looking and do something about it we are great at talking in this house but we are not so good at action
i have one other point in relation to competition
i make some complaints to the commission on behalf of constituents
the small person gets no hearing against the state and i would like the commission to take this back that there are some complaints which i as a member have not
