madam president i really will not take a minute because being from ireland i have not been lobbied by wine producers
i think there is a general concern about the pulling together of so many different sectors in a single cmo
we really will not know if it works until it is done
i will therefore listen to the concerns of those who know more about the wine sector while realising that we do have to move this process on
i hope that we will get better reassurances from the commission because we do need to listen to the concerns of the producers
