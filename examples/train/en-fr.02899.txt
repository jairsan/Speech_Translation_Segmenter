madam president two and a half years ago i presented to this plenary a report on misleading business directories
the message that this parliament gave was clear that there is a serious problem with fraudulent practices by misleading business directories that tens of thousands of our small businesses voluntary organisations and even charities are falling victim to these fraudulent practices and that we need a concerted approach to stop once and for all such deceptive practices
two and a half years later unfortunately we are back here in plenary to discuss the same subject because there has been a serious lack of action to combat the problem of misleading business directories
this is not acceptable
let me remind colleagues what we are talking about here
basically what this involves is that a misleading business directory sends out a form which appears to simply request people to update their own personal details or their business details in return for what appears to be a free entry a free listing in the business directory
at first glance one does not notice any cost any payment that might result from filling in this form
however after submitting the form victims receive a letter demanding payment of eur one zero per year for three consecutive years
if they do not pay the misleading business directories resort to what are essentially bullying tactics harassing telephone calls threats of legal action and pursuit by debt collectors
the most worrying thing is that such illegal tactics are being used under the very noses of the authorities of several member states who are well aware of these practices and have not taken any action to stop them
the european city guide construct data temdi eu business services world business directory expo guide and dad are still operating unabated
the commission has already stated that such misleading practices are against eu law but it has not done enough to stop them
this is why we are here today
