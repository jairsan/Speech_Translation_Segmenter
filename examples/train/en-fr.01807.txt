president barroso you have been a supporter of northern ireland and the important progress that has been achieved in creating a stable and peaceful future for our people
in your task force report you indicated your support and that of the commission for the local devolved administration and the work that it is doing in securing a peaceful and prosperous future for the people of northern ireland
in this time of economic turbulence the agri-food industry in northern ireland is one of the most important sectors of the economy
this very important work could suffer from the proposed penalties for alleged breaches of the single farm payment scheme identified by commission auditors
mr barroso would you agree that the proposed penalties on the department of agriculture and rural development in northern ireland for breaches of the sfp scheme between two thousand and four and two thousand and six are disproportionate in relation to the actual risk to the scheme
will you and dg agri agree to look again at the suggestion of a five per cent flat-rate disallowance given that the department in northern ireland is taking remedial steps to ensure that systems are accurate and that money has already been recovered in relation to the original claims
