madam president we are all aware of the importance of bees in pollination
they are absolutely crucial to agriculture and food production
indeed without them there is no food production
it is therefore very worrying that the beekeeping sector continues to report that the mortality rates are astonishingly high
although i feel that we have been successful in raising the awareness and communicating the severity of the situation over the years we must maintain pressure to ensure that research into the cause of these mortality rates continues and remains well funded
only then can concrete steps be taken to address the problem
firstly i wish to see that funding for research projects is maintained after twenty twelve and i would support the initiatives which encourage young beekeepers into the apiculture sector
we are of course entering a period of intense debate on the future of the cap and i believe that this is a fundamental problem that should continue to be addressed in the context of a revised eu agricultural policy after twenty thirteen
in essence support for the agriculture sector should be strengthened after twenty thirteen
i think we have an opportunity to do something positive
let us support the bees
