mr president i have spent some considerable time in croatia and also taken pains to follow developments there
croatia is a country which is characterised by endemic bribery corruption crony capitalism and unexplained wealth amongst the political classes
it lacks the basic infrastructure of a free society
the rule of law the rights of property and enforceable contracts are all seriously challenged in croatia
the judicial system is completely log-jammed so the citizens and companies operating in croatia cannot effectively appeal for justice
the croatian media are subject to censorship and intimidation
if this country croatia is considered a suitable country for joining the european union then heaven help all of us
