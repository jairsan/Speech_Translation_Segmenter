madam president there is a lot of self-congratulation going on here in the european union on international women's day
it is my opinion that you have made a complete dog's breakfast of it
you talk about maternity leave
all that is happening with draconian maternity leave let me tell you madam is that fewer and fewer young women in my country are getting jobs because you would have to be stark staring mad to employ a young woman if you have a small business
so you have done them no favours
we have equal opportunities for car insurance now due to another lunatic judgment by the european court which means that even if young women could get a job they could not afford to drive to it because they have just had their car insurance doubled
and now you are talking about quotas
what kind of madness is this
women who have worked all their lives to get to a position of responsibility in business professional women are being patronised on quotas
now those women who have been successful will sit in a boardroom and people will look across that boardroom and say are you a token woman or did you get there because you know your business
the whole thing is completely crazy and it is a tragedy that none of you have done a real job in your lives or you would understand this
