mr president yesterday in ireland a conference addressed the topic of aid and eastern europe
one of the countries we spoke about was georgia and it was really refreshing to hear how much progress had been made for a particular group of individuals with no voice children with disabilities both intellectual and physical and young adults but also deeply depressing to learn that those involved believe that they are now set back by ten years because of the conflict
i would just ask because i was involved yesterday that you bear in mind the most vulnerable when we are doing trade agreements and having conversations
this was a very important debate here but the horrific humanitarian situation has been spoken about by other colleagues and there is a group of people who is always forgotten i just wanted their voice to be heard here today
