madam president first of all i would like to say that this is an excellent report
we are always speaking about connecting the eu to its citizens and the fact that the eu project cannot proceed without the involvement of eu citizens
there are two types of democracy representative which we have in this house and participative which is what this report is all about
however it is important to understand that civil dialogue is two-sided
it is reciprocal
therefore the concerns and ideas put forward by citizens must be taken into consideration by the eu institutions
i think we have an excellent example of that in the one million signatures for disability and the document that we are debating in this parliament at the moment
i disagree with the last speaker because i believe if we do pass the lisbon treaty that it gives us the opportunity to connect citizens to the eu in a much more meaningful way
our role in this house is to ensure if we pass the lisbon treaty that it works effectively
