madam president for years this house has criticised the united states over the suspension of civic freedoms inherent in the maintenance of the secure facility at guantánamo
mine was among the voices raised in concern
i accepted unlike some in this chamber that these were difficult and sensitive issues
a number of detainees were released only to be recaptured on the battlefields of afghanistan
one blew himself up in a market in iraq killing dozens of people
nonetheless some principles are absolute and ought not to be sacrificed to expediency
one such is the principle that no one should be detained without being accused of an offence
colleagues we prefaced each of our resolutions on guantánamo with protestations of goodwill
we spoke we insisted as friends of the united states
well here is our chance to vindicate that boast
the us administration in doing what we have long urged asks our assistance
not to tender it would be mean inconsistent hypocritical and self-defeating
