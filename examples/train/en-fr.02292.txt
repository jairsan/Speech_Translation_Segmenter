mr president the commission condemns the use of corporal punishment
it conflicts with international human rights principles and norms as set out by the united nations
these principles are also reflected in the european union guidelines for eu policy towards third countries on torture and other forms of cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
the recent report by amnesty international on the practice of caning in malaysia is worrying
however the commission would like to suggest widening the resolution to cover all countries where judicial caning unfortunately still occurs
the european union together with the united nations has quite regularly raised the question of caning with malaysia
some member states also did so in the context of the ratification of the un convention against torture and during the un human rights council's universal periodic review which took place in february two thousand and nine
only last week at the united nations seminar on the occasion of human rights day malaysia was urged to ratify more un conventions in particular the un convention against torture
in early twenty ten the same question was raised by the eu head of mission directly with the minister of foreign affairs
it is an issue to which we pay a lot of attention
the european union and malaysia will soon begin negotiations on a partnership and cooperation agreement which will contain provisions on human rights
once this agreement enters into force it will provide a sound formalised basis for a reinforced and regular dialogue with malaysia on human rights
in the meantime we will continue raising this issue with the malaysian authorities
