mr president the establishment of a european asylum support office goes totally against the british opt-out on immigration and is at odds with the uk rejection of the schengen
the proposal that eur forty million will be spent establishing and staffing an entire office in malta to deal with asylum seekers across the eu suggests that this commission wants to make the decisions that should be left to national governments
any common european asylum policy threatens british sovereignty over border control
repeated appeals to let the uk decide who comes in and out of the country and who can be accommodated arise from the fact that we have a huge population problem that is quite unlike the situation anywhere else in europe
the commission does not offer help and support when the uk is struggling
instead it will take the money of the british taxpayer to cover the cost of making our decisions on our behalf
eur forty million would be better directed towards building new schools hospitals and houses in the uk as well as affording critical services such as clean water desperately needed if we are to continue providing a decent first world quality of life for everyone
one in four births are to mothers who themselves were not born in the uk that is one hundred and seventy zero births a year
where is the money to help the british taxpayer afford all this
in your pocket or spent on setting up a new asylum office which will no doubt pile more pressure on to the uk
in our election campaigns all the parties in the uk are promising to do something about immigration because the people back home are demanding something should be done
but what can westminster do as long as we are in the eu because at exactly the same time the european commission wants all the powers over asylum seekers passed to them
time and again this commission has shown only disregard for the wants and needs of the uk people
is it the commission's intention to repeal the uk opt-out in this area too
the people back home deserve your honesty because this issue is extremely important to them
you are supposed to represent them and they deserve to know what you have planned
