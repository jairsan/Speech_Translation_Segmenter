mr president less than twenty years ago croatia fought to secure its independence
now it is being handed out without a shot being fired
croatia has had to make extensive and intrusive legislative changes
it has also had to withdraw support from its vital industries and the people who work in them
the croatians must do all of these things before the european union condescends to accept croatia for membership
of greatest importance all of these changes are being conceded before the consent of the people through a promised referendum has been granted or even asked for
despite opinion-poll evidence of majority opposition to eu membership a positive outcome of the referendum is taken for granted
when enormous changes are carried out in anticipation of a consent that is yet to be obtained we can be assured that consent is seen as a mere formality
the report here says that editors and journalists complain about undue political pressure
however it is silent about how this pressure will allow the referendum to be conducted freely and fairly
