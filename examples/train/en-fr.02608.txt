madam president the images of the massive earthquake and tsunami in north-eastern japan are terrifying our thoughts and heartfelt sympathies go to those who have lost homes and loved ones
of course we welcome the eu help package
in fukushima personnel are still working at the site of the nuclear power plant to prevent further radiation contamination and this of course has to be assessed thoroughly all over the european union including in brussels
i welcome the stress test proposed by the commission but i think it has to be added that we cannot just have a stress test based on technology and geography
we need two other steps
one is on the security culture where it obviously has been impossible to envisage multiple risks
the second is on the institutional framework including an oversight of the relationships between the national regulatory bodies and the nuclear companies
furthermore authorities should not be allowed to audit themselves
finally as we evaluate the consequences of the disaster we should base our discussion on information and knowledge
radical measures might be necessary i would think necessary
but one thing should be obvious we have to reform our energy production and to rely instead on renewable energy and we have to do it now
