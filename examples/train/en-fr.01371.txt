mr president sadly there has been a general climate in the islamic world of increasing jihadi militancy aimed at non-muslim communities in their midst in particular and more often than not this means the christians
the copts who represent one of the oldest christian churches in the world have a large diaspora in london which i represent
their leaders have come to me and complained of a worsening situation regrettably in egypt orchestrated by the muslim brotherhood
in spite of the best efforts by president mubarak's government to protect them matters have deteriorated
we witness a similar story with the assyrian christians in iraq the christians of palestine and pakistan and now as we see for the first time even in malaysia
this house has for too long in my view ignored christian minority rights in the rest of the world but they look to the european union and to the united states for protection
so i welcome this resolution
