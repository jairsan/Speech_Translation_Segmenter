mr president we have only a minute so i shall dispense with the pleasantries
i should like to defend your honour against one of my irish colleagues joe higgins
i would remind mr higgins that you in your work in the solidarity movement defended workers and their rights and i think the historical facts should be reflected it in this house
a little bit of controversy is no bad thing but it is quite extraordinary that this morning we have nigel farage on the one side and sinn f√©in and joe higgins on the other side the extremes of the right and left talking against the lisbon treaty
i think that should be a good enough reason for the rest of us to vote yes to the lisbon treaty and for irish voters who will be making up their own minds on two october to listen to the voices who are urging them to vote no and to listen very carefully to judge what they stand for and then to listen to the voices of reason and reflect on the fact that the european union has been very good for ireland and ireland good for it and that we will continue to remain at the heart of europe by supporting this treaty
