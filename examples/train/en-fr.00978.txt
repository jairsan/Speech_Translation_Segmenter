madam president i am in favour of visa liberalisation and i am also in favour of attaching certain criteria to visa liberalisation but what i am more in favour of is peace and stability in the western balkans
what do you think it will do especially to young people to bosnian muslims to see their croat- and serb-bosnian peers with double passports hopping in and out of the eu for a weekend
do we really want to take the chance of fostering nationalist feelings and deepening the divisions in a country where stability is still so fragile
and for what
bosnia and herzegovina is really not that far behind serbia in complying with the criteria
they are already issuing biometric passports and have made about the same amount of progress on the other criteria
i therefore strongly ask you to include bosnia and herzegovina in the present proposal for the sake of those people living there who are working very hard for a better future with the memories of war still too fresh in their minds
