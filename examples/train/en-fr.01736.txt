madam president the stockholm programme is undoubtedly ambitious but we still need to adopt an action plan that would implement it in the most efficient way
efficiency means not only a suitable timetable but it also refers to the content of the legislation that we will adopt in the coming years and to the institutions that will be built upon in the future
if we want the union to be more coherent we have to work towards a level of trust and mutual recognition in the judicial area or on police cooperation similar to the principle which has governed the eu single market
to achieve it we need to shift our views on our legal traditions which should no longer be perceived used or misused to prevent us having minimum standards particularly in criminal law
our citizens demand and deserve better protection against terrorism and against organised or trans-border crime
it is our duty to provide for this protection but we have to do it while fully respecting not only the rights of the victims but also those of the defendants as well
this is why minimal procedural standards must apply to all eu member states and if we need to be bold for these we shall be
we will be bold when entrusting eurojust with more power or when we have to protect the data of our citizens or when we will have to regulate on the asylum package
my political group is determined to constructively work with the commission and the council and at the same time to persistently fight for the protection of human rights
