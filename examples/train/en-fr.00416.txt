mr president once more we have preened ourselves in this parliament on our green credentials and speakers have competed to push higher and higher the unrealistic targets for energy from only renewable sources and the targets for reductions of co emissions all in the belief that by our puny but costly efforts we will save the planet
yes we should use and promote sustainable energy sources but pursuit of what for most has become a dogma with no regard to cost or viability needs to be tempered by reality including the reality that climate change is not new but cyclical as well as the reality that while we inflict these targets on ourselves manufacturing increasingly switches to where no such restraints inhibit them
one day we will have to account for the own goals in which the eu excels
