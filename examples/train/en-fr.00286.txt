mr president i very much welcome the idea of the commission preparing an action plan on e-justice
i was quite surprised to learn that such an initiative had not yet been introduced
i would like to thank my colleague diana wallis for tackling this pressing issue in a very befitting manner
rapid technological development has provided us with new efficient tools that we should not hesitate to use
alas it has also presented us with new challenges including e-crimes such as unauthorised monitoring fraud cyber warfare and many more
it is high time for the european union to launch legislation on the definition investigation and penalisation of e-crime
e-crime crosses national borders and should therefore be addressed at supranational level
i expect the commission to take a legislative initiative on this matter very promptly
