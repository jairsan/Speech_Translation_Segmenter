madam president my group proposes to delete paragraphs two and six
this is not because we do not support the content but because we do not think it is necessary in this resolution and that given the delicacy of the situation it might help get mr al-bashir to reverse his decision and allow the ngos to go back
so we are calling for the deletion of paragraphs two and six
i understand there will be a similar request from the socialists and they will also be requesting the deletion of paragraph five which we also support for similar reasons
