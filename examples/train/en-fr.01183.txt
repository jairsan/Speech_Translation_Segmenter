mr president this debate has been about the liberalisation of trade and i stand before this house tonight as a european who believes in the cooperation of nations but not as one who believes in the federalism of the current project
for the united kingdom lisbon will decrease our powers to control trade and exercise trade with whomsoever we will
furthermore the diminution of our democracy both in the united kingdom and in europe is apparent with the events of last week where we had the appointment of a president and the anointing of a high representative of foreign affairs who has never held elected office but who will speak for the people of europe on foreign affairs
surely this is not a situation that the commission can stand over and it would be interesting to hear its views
