this is an area that i personally have had discussions with the car rental companies about
there are other issues apart from this for example damage claims of an unexpectedly high nature and cars not inspected
i wonder therefore if the commissioner would agree with me that under the provisions of the services directive for the cross-border supply of services member states are explicitly encouraged to promote proper codes of conduct for cross-border service supply
this seems to be exactly the sort of area where we should be encouraging member states perhaps facilitated by the commission to get the car rental operators together to produce a code of conduct that reputable operators would have to sign up to which would cover the issues that my colleagues are talking about plus other serious consumer issues as well
