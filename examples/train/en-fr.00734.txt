mr president i wish to thank all the speakers in tonight's debate for their constructive contributions
it is important to underline that tackling global deforestation and forest degradation is a complex issue
solving it requires real political will and actions on the demand side
we should keep in mind that patterns of tropical deforestation are the result of the interaction of a number of different factors which vary in importance in different locations
forest cover is not only affected by forest policies but also by other policies such as taxation policy land tenure and rights
in the european union we understand that working on the coherence of our policies must go hand in hand with supporting countries in their efforts to strengthen national and local institutions and make progress towards effective governance and use of forest resources
i wish to thank again ms lucas mr ford and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent work
i am encouraged that parliament while endorsing the approach of the commission wants to reinforce it further and has made amendments to this end
let me assure you that i fully share parliament's objective of putting in place an ambitious regulation to address illegal logging and its associated trade
i also want to assure you that the commission will give careful consideration to the amendments of the proposed regulation
to conclude i would like in particular to comment on two of the issues addressed tonight
firstly i would like to refer to the due-diligence approach which is more comprehensive than just a certificate of legality
the principle of due diligence reflects the legal obligation of a proactive behaviour to a certain legality and needs to be demonstrated on a basis of comprehensive measures which will enable legality to be reasonably assured
in some cases a certificate of legality will only be a starting point the first measure included in the due diligence procedure
where the risk assessment has shown that the country of origin presents a higher risk of administrative corruption or in countries where enforcement of national laws is weak additional guarantees are necessary to underpin the certified legality
the other issue i would like to address is the proposed extension of the scope to cover downstream operators
according to the principles of better regulation and a reduction of administrative burden requiring distributors and retailers to demand proof of the due diligence from the proceeding market obligators appears to be excessive
if timber was made subject to due-diligence enquires when first placed on the market why unduly burden downstream operators
in summary out of the seventy-five proposed amendments the commission can support fully in part or in principle thirty-seven
i will provide parliament's secretariat with a list detailing the commission's position on the amendments
