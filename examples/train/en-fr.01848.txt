madam president as a former self-employed truck driver i support keeping the self-employed in this directive
own-account drivers i know for a fact are under tremendous pressure to work night and day
commissioner kallas your speech and your proposal is a disgrace
it puts drivers health and safety at risk
it puts other road users at risk
it puts smes at risk from unfair competition and it puts increased pressure on decent employers to push their employees into self-employment
fifty per cent of drivers have admitted falling asleep at the wheel
twenty per cent of accidents are due to fatigue
thirty per cent of drivers working time is taken up loading and unloading and helping passengers
ms harkin if you are still here what they do in their attic is their own business
this parliament must stand up for citizens <unk> and against those who want an unregulated transport sector
commissioner kallas go back to the drawing board
