madam president i would like to thank the rapporteur for this very important report
it is good to see that industry is back on europe's agenda
i think that what we need is a balanced european economy
i speak mainly on agriculture and food policy but i was moved to participate in this debate because i think talking about industry and agriculture and services is really important
europe needs a balance of all three and not to recognise that would be very foolish
i want in particular to draw attention to paragraph one hundred and twelve which talks about free trade being the cornerstone of europe's economic growth but also talks about fair global competition and in particular urges that when we come to do bilateral trade agreements or multilateral agreements we must take account of the principles of sustainable development social and environmental concerns and relevant standards in those agreements
those of us on the agriculture side would say the very same
so i think this is an important report on all fronts
