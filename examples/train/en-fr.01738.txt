madam president dame sarah ludford said that she had some concerns about miscarriages of justice in relation to the european arrest warrant in the cases of andrew symeou and gary mann
that is an understatement if ever there was one the european arrest warrant is a gross miscarriage of justice in itself
extradition has been reduced to a mere bureaucratic formality
british courts have been stripped of their ability to protect british citizens from unjust arrest and imprisonment when they are extradited to a foreign country
i know because i sat in the appeal court in the case of andrew symeou when two senior law lords were unable to prevent the extradition of mr symeou even though it was obvious to everybody in the court that the evidence was either non-existent or fabricated by the police
but of course that is the whole point because the court is not allowed to look at the evidence they have no right
dame sarah and the lib dems can cry crocodile tears now over cases like mr symeou but they have to bear responsibility for the human misery which they have caused
