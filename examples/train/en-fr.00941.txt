mr president this parliament will have many important discussions and decisions to make on budget matters
currently we are of course looking at the twenty ten budget and there are still a lot of issues to be resolved before we can agree that
this parliament will also soon start discussing the new financial perspective for the period post twenty thirteen
but there is also the mid-term budget review and it seems to me we have almost forgotten about that
we should not forget about it because this will give us great opportunities in the future
it will give us the opportunity to look again at what our priorities are
it will give us the opportunity for example to put more funds into a new economic regeneration plan for europe
it will also perhaps give us the opportunity to put extra funding into the measures which come out of copenhagen at the end of this year
i believe that this parliament should not take its eye off the ball
this parliament should continue to press the council and the commission to make sure it looks again at that mid-term review and to give us the opportunity to put forward our priorities
