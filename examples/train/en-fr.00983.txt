madam president mr landsbergis has given a deeply unconvincing justification of this law
i was surprised i thought he would justify it more
the council and the commission have expressed their deep concern and that is the correct line
anti-discrimination and freedom of expression are absolutely fundamental principles in european law
in my own member state as mr cashman said previously we had such a law in nineteen eighty-eight but it is now history and this law will become history because as a community of values one of the eu's greatest strengths lies in our common endeavour to raise the bar on human rights and the protection of our fundamental freedoms
it is also difficult when one member state is under the spotlight for a potential breach of this law but it is because of our community of values that we can analyse those laws and we can say as the commission and council have said they cause deep concern for us
the fundamental rights agency should do its job and give its opinion and as the commission and council have said there are problems within existing law anti-discrimination laws in this european union let us defend what we have and let us ensure that the socialist group along with our sister party in lithuania condemn this law and let us hope that that is what will happen that it will be consigned to history
