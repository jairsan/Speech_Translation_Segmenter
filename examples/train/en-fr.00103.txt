madam president the internal market is not an end in itself
it is an instrument for the improvement of living and working conditions for everyone and therefore weaknesses in the posting of workers directive which can be used to facilitate a race to the bottom must be removed as a matter of urgency
the socialist group has managed to construct an overwhelming majority of members in the committee on employment and social affairs in support of such reforms
the only groups standing aside from this consensus are the far right and the far left and they prefer to play party politics rather than seek to find a political solution to the problems
we in this parliament must deliver a clear demand to the commission and the member state governments that decent pay and working conditions cannot be sacrificed on the altar of the single market
europe can only be successfully competitive on the basis of high-quality services and goods not on the basis of driving down standards of living
i welcome the commission's indications today that it is now ready to re-examine the posting of workers directive that it is in need of reform but the question commissioner is when
when will you bring forward an initiative to this house clearly outlining what amendments you are proposing to the posting of workers directive
there is clearly a need to safeguard and to strengthen equal treatment and equal pay for equal work in the same workplace as already laid down in article thirty-nine twelve of the european community treaty
the freedom to provide services or the freedom of establishment the nationality of the employer of employees or of posted workers cannot serve as a justification for inequalities concerning working conditions pay or the exercise of fundamental rights such as the workers right to take collective action
