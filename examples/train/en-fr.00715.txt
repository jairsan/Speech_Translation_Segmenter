mr president i was delighted to support this report because i have always fought against all types of discrimination
i think it is vital that we have a framework to prevent exploitation of people because of their religion age disability education or marital status
without protection against discrimination on these grounds our ambitions for a social europe will be meaningless
this will particularly be the case during the current economic situation
there is always a temptation during these difficult times to exploit those who are less able to defend themselves to cut corners when it comes to regulation designed precisely to protect against such exploitation
in my constituency the west midlands we are threatened with the rise of far-right politics
i believe europe has a key role to play in ensuring people know they are protected in the face of aggression and exploitation
