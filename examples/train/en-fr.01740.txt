i will promise to start answering very briefly because the document to which the honourable member refers is not a document adopted by the commission and its release was not authorised but later this month the commission intends to adopt the communication to the council and the parliament assessing the benefits and the costs of the eu stepping up to a target of thirty reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
this communication was actually requested by the environment council in its conclusions dated fifteen march this year
so needless to say we have had a very short time but we think it is an important debate afterwards there will of course be a lot of details that we have to look at more closely
in addition this communication will present as requested under the ets directive an analysis of the situation of energy intensive sectors that it has been determined are exposed to a risk of carbon leakage in the light of the outcome of copenhagen
but let me just say one thing very clearly
it is not the intention of the commission to take a decision to go to thirty the day after this communication has been presented
it is just one step to try to ensure that when we have the discussions on these reduction targets we have a very informed foundation to take this discussion forward from
that is the purpose of this to give us the analysis the costs the figures and the calculations so that we can have an informed debate
i really hope that parliament will also take part in this debate
