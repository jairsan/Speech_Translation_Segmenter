mr president the countries of the european union should put their own houses in order before pointing their fingers at others
many european union members prosecute and imprison people for non-violent freedom of speech
in particular they seek to make any opposition to immigration a criminal offence
book-burning is alive and well
political parties are banned as in belgium or their ban is sought on invented evidence as in germany or a backdoor ban is sought as in the united kingdom where my own party has been banned by a court order sought by the government from accepting new members for an indefinite period
it is not enough for countries to call themselves democratic they must also respect freedom of speech they must respect freedom of association and they must respect freedom of elections
