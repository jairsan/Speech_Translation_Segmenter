mr president once again thank you very much for the comments and for the fruitful cooperation we had in the process
thank you for all the comments and for the support i received from the majority of the colleagues who spoke
i would like to thank the inta draftsperson mr kazak for the constructive ideas presented by his committee and the contribution of the itre committee many of whose suggestions found their place in the report
my gratitude goes also to the afet secretariat and for the numerous experts ngos and other organisations who work actively in the region and who gave their valuable input and support
i just want to say one thing
we should apply the same principles
i heard some criticism from some colleagues
we should know that this house definitely would not support us if we speak about territorial integrity and self-determination for georgia
we should know that the universal application of principles is the best basis to start and build relationships
i hope that the council and the commission will take on board the recommendation made by the parliament in this text and devise a comprehensive strategy for the eu towards the south caucasus and i would like to point out that commissioner f√ºle made a very timely visit to this region
i would like to appeal to baroness ashton to do likewise and try to engage in conflict prevention in the area
let me say that we welcome and support last week's decision by the council to adopt the negotiating directives for the future association agreements with the three countries and we believe that upgrading the contractual relations with the three countries is an important step
the time is right to step up with measures to prevent negative developments in the region and the escalation of tensions
otherwise we risk intervening again when it is already too late
we should not wait for it to happen again
the big lesson europe has learnt is the lesson of integration
this is the only sustainable way of reconciliation with the past and investment in a better future
