madam president i thank michael cashman for the passion he has brought to this debate
i am very glad that i stayed to listen to his words and i hope that others will hear them and act upon them
my concern in relation to this issue is that the fear we had in the nineteen eighties has been forgotten and as a result we are taking our eye off the situation when there is a whole generation of people who did not grow up in the nineteen eighties who need to hear the message again
the challenge for us all is to try and bring a message of prevention into the public domain while not bringing back the stigma that sometimes comes with it
we have to be able to do this because while testing is vital and treatment is absolutely vital for those who have the disease we also want to stop people getting aids living with it and tragically dying from it
