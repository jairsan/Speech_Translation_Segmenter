madam president in taking this opportunity to speak on behalf of the s d shadow ms guillaume i would like to thank the rapporteur mr díaz de mera garcía consuegra for having actively consulted all the shadows in his usual way and successfully pushed forward the negotiations with the council
whereas the commission proposal consists of mostly technical modifications this report has in my view allowed for a better understanding and consideration of the complexity and scope of the liaison officers activities
immigration liaison officers ilos are indeed engaged in quite complex and opaque activities
it is therefore absolutely necessary for reasons of transparency to further a better exchange of information with the european parliament on the one hand and organisations such as the unhcr and the asylum support office on the other
it is also fundamental to include and promote the human rights orientated approach to the mission of ilos which the commissioner has just mentioned
it is surely needless to recall that in the context of addressing mixed migratory movements the posting of ilos in third countries may raise several concerns from a fundamental rights perspective in particular regarding the right of individuals to leave a country including their own and the right of asylum seekers to flee and find protection from persecution
finally on the heated debate concerning terminology we have in the explanatory memorandum a satisfactory compromise for what seems to be an endless debate
i will finish by thanking mr díaz de mera garcía consuegra and saying that our group will fully support his report
