madam president whereas the total focus of this summit should be on the economic crisis afflicting us all sadly much time will be devoted to how to subjugate the democratically expressed will of the irish electorate
the disrespect for the lawfully expressed opinion of a small country on the treaty of lisbon is palpable
no one would dare try such a juggernaut mugabe approach with a large country
but the voters of the republic of ireland are fair game to be pushed around by the european elite to whom their precious lisbon project is more important than the democracy of a nation state
it is such arrogance such intent on browbeating those who thwart their design which has brought the eu to such disconnection with its people
this whole unseemly saga has more of the politics of the bully boy about it than of democracy
