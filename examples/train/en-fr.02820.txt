mr president just when responsible people and governments are watching every penny the commission proposes more expense youth on the move card european skills passport european vacancy monitor through europe twenty twenty all for cultural diplomacy and to get young people to travel when they do that already backpacking their way round the world on their own initiative
what do we need expensive promotions for
as for spreading european culture well make the most of it because the way this crazy eu is going there will be none left just a meaningless mantra united in diversity
do you not understand that europe is not a single state but a wide and glorious tapestry of attractive distinctive but matching cultural panels and to amalgamate them is to reduce them all to a grey amorphous mass thereby destroying that which you say you admire
do not push eu culture make italian german french dutch british and all the other cultures available for all who want to sample them and the rest will follow
