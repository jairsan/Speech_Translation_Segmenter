mr president i want to explain why i voted against the twenty eleven budget
i voted against it because in a time of austerity the eu should show restraint
we should be cutting our expenditure not increasing it
in my view it was shameful that the commission initially proposed a six increase and parliament supported that
i believe that my prime minister david cameron did a good job in forcing the level of increase down to two point nine but we know that this was a compromise
it is not a compromise that british conservatives are particularly pleased with and i was proud to vote against eu extravagance
