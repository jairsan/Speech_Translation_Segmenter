madam president mr leichtfried is right
the cost for extra security should in the end be covered by the member states
after all the passengers and every citizen are already paying the member states for their security in general
the state cannot simply say to its citizens you get exactly what you pay for
its obligations go beyond that because the state is not simply another service provider motivated exclusively by profit
i am reminding you of this simple truth because in spite of this principle the passengers and not their states are footing the bill for extra air security in the end as the rapporteur rightly notes
moreover many times the extra security that passengers are getting by paying extra charges is not even provided by the state but by subcontracted private companies often disregarding the passengers and their rights under the general shelter provided by the secrecy covering security matters in general
that simply should stop
