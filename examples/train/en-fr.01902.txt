madam president mr bové's report is very topical and i welcome the fact that we have an opportunity to explore these issues regarding the function of europe's food supply chain in the committee on agriculture and rural development
there are undoubtedly certain problems in europe's food supply chain
the recent extreme commodity prices and volatility in the market have in my opinion undermined food chain stability
it must be acknowledged that farmers are experiencing consistently falling farm-gate prices coupled with ever-increasing operational costs whilst retailers and consumers continue to enjoy handsome profits and low prices respectively
in this regard i agree with mr bové that there are problems which have to be addressed in order to achieve a balance between fairness and profitability
however i do not entirely agree with the suggestions in mr bové's report as to how to rectify this imbalance and in this regard i have tabled an alternative resolution on behalf of my group
i certainly do not believe that the answer is to introduce yet more european union legislation to enforce mandatory codes of conduct upon farmers
existing eu competition laws are adequate and should be properly enforced
the food supply chain must be allowed to operate in the context of the free market and as far as possible be free of unnecessary burdensome regulation and red tape
greater price transparency in the food supply chain is required as is an end to unfair practices by retailers such as stocking fees and unacceptably late payments to producers
on the other hand farmers need to be encouraged to organise themselves in a more effective manner so that they can increase their bargaining power in relation to large processors and retailers
in my opinion the way forward is to tackle anti-competitive practices and promote voluntary codes of good practice
over the summer we have seen grain prices shoot through the roof which is only going to make even greater problems in the food supply chain
this volatility in the market is really destroying the market
