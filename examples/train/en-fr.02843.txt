mr barroso we have enjoyed a series of pantomime exchanges on the euro
every time i have predicted that a country would need a bail-out you have come back and said oh no they don t everything is fine
and now we face the fourth bail-out the second greek bail-out unless of course today you are going to tell us that is not necessary either
but the question i want to ask you today is perhaps far more serious than anything that has happened in greece or ireland or portugal to date
it is about the real sovereign debt crisis which we may face within the next few weeks and which concerns the integrity of the european central bank itself
month after month i have warned that you cannot go on buying up vast quantities of your own bad debt
mr barroso do you accept that the finances of the european central bank and its integrity are now in a serious and parlous state
