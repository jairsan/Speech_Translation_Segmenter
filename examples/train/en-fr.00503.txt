madam president one in four people experience mental health problems at least once in their lives
eight of the ten leading causes of disability are mental health issues and mental health problems have a huge effect on those not directly affected
therefore we urgently need to update mental health legislation that can properly develop an awareness of the importance of good mental health
the message i have been trying to get across in my constituency in the west midlands is that the media the internet schools and workplaces all have a vital role to play in making the public aware
however we also need more research into the field of mental health and the interaction between mental and physical health problems and an explanation of how mental health initiatives might be funded under the european social fund and the european regional development fund
this needs to be undertaken urgently
employers also need to promote a healthy working climate paying attention to work-related stress and the underlying causes of mental disorder at the workplace and tackling those causes
i was therefore very pleased to support this report
