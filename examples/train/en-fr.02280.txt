madam president firstly a complaint
you said this is an important debate and it is
i find it somewhat unacceptable that mr barroso and many of the political leaders have departed the chamber as soon as they have given their speeches
in fairness to mr schulz he has stayed here from the beginning to the end and i would like to compliment him on that
secondly i want to say that when all is said and done one of the main reasons for the financial crisis is that governments failed to govern and political leaders failed to lead
thankfully we are now bringing that situation under control with the new supervisory architecture which should be coming in on one january the credit rating agencies report which we dealt with last night and today's permanent financial stability mechanism
they are all to be welcomed
if mr barroso were here i would like to ask him if he can guarantee that a referendum will not be required in ireland and elsewhere to make the minimum treaty changes he spoke of
finally i want to say to those who have asked that a written declaration be signed by members that this is a direct attack on corporation tax in ireland
that should not be done
