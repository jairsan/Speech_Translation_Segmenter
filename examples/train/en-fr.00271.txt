mr president i agree that we cannot ignore the reality of coal and the size of reserves and the dependence on coal in many member states and across the world russian china australia the united states
as we drive renewable technologies carbon sequestration technologies must go hand-in-hand
the commission's proposal of two years ago of up to twelve ccs plants had awaited funding to date
i was very pleased with the agreement in relation to my report on three hundred million allowances for driving the potential of this technology
my original rather modest proposal using the generous new installations reserve was so enthusiastically supported by mr davies and other colleagues that i amended my own report with significantly higher figures
thank you to the presidency thank you to the commission thank you to mr davies ms mcavan and colleagues for your support on this point
as we rapidly exhaust our planet's capacity to absorb co through biological sequestration we look to our own ingenuity with new sequestration technologies particularly the potentially transforming technology of ccs if through these twelve projects the environmental integrity and commercial viability of these processes is proven
