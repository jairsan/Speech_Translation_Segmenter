mr president in nineteen sixty the swedish secretary-general of the united nations dag hammarskj√∂ld asked the irish troops to go as peacemakers into what was then the belgian congo which became the congo
they did a tremendous job
i am extremely worried about the role of the united nations troops in the congo at present the moroccans the pakistanis and the indians
we are talking about rape violence trading and so on but the united nations troops there are not covering themselves in glory and are actually doing a disservice
i agree completely with mr mitchell that the european union needs to take a firmer hand
we are a european union totally united
we did excellent work in chad
we need our own peacekeepers in there and we cannot rely on the united nations
the situation is that we have a beautiful people victims of european colonisation victims of tribal conflict victims of international blindness and we cannot be blind any longer
we simply have to go in and save those people
