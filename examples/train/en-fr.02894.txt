mr president a military in madagascar has been followed by continual violations of human rights and civil liberties
we have had to witness the concentration of executive legislative and judiciary powers together with the media in the hands of andry rajoelina who prides himself on the title of the president of the high transitional authority
i am pleased that the eu and its member states have not recognised his illegitimate government
we should never give credit to any authoritarian ruler by engaging in formal relations even if we have done so in the past
therefore i welcome the sanctions that have so far been imposed on the regime and encourage the international community to extend them in order to overthrow rajoelina's government and bring about a true and definitive transition to democracy
