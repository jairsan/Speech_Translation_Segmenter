madam president the eu is closely following the situation in venezuela
in this regard i would like to note that we share the concerns expressed here about the circumstances of the arrest and detention of judge maría lourdes afiuni and the subsequent statements with regard to her arrest made by the venezuelan authorities
it is important to note that the un special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the un working group on arbitrary detention qualified the arrest of judge maría lourdes afiuni as a deeply disturbing blow to judicial independence
un experts went further by stating that reprisals for exercising their constitutionally guaranteed functions and creating a climate of fear among the judiciary and the lawyers profession served no purpose except to undermine the rule of law and obstruct justice arguing that the immediate and unconditional release of judge afiuni is imperative
the inter-american commission on human rights issued a protective measure in favour of judge maría lourdes afiuni stressing the responsibility to protect her life and physical integrity and also to transfer her to a safe place
although the venezuelan authorities reported that she has been held separately from the general prison population as has been mentioned here she continues to be behind bars at the national institute of feminine orientation whose inmates could include people she sentenced
in the context of our dialogue with the venezuelan authorities we have always stressed the importance of fully respecting international obligations and commitments on human rights including freedom of expression respect for the rule of law and especially respect for judicial independence
these issues have been firmly raised in the context of our dialogue with the venezuelan authorities and while the authorities have been arguing that this imprisonment is in conformity with venezuelan legislation we have felt that this is an issue based on the judgement of the un and the inter-american commission on human rights and our own judgement that we are deeply concerned about
we are following the tendency of political polarisation re-emerging in the country with concern
the september legislative elections are widely seen as a milestone for the future of the country and it is now timely for the eu to underline the importance that these elections be held in a peaceful transparent and fully democratic environment
i would like to take this opportunity to stress that the eu encourages all actors to engage in the electoral process in a spirit of tolerance civil-mindedness and respect for pluralism of opinions
we will continue to follow developments in venezuela closely in the context and based on the foundation of our commitment to support and strengthen democracy and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms everywhere in the world including in venezuela
