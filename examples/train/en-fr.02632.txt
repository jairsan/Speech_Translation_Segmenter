mr president in these times of austerity the commission is rationalising as well
mr simpson as rapporteur you said that this is a technical report and it is indeed but nevertheless it is an important one
the purpose of the proposal from the commission was to update and optimise the existing legal framework for european statistics on tourism
both producers and users of tourism statistics have requested this adjustment
so the ultimate aim is to provide monthly and annual european statistics on tourism supply and demand using a common framework
the proposal is very well balanced in terms of data needs and the burden put on respondents and administrators
to achieve this permission has been included to collect some parts of the data on an optional basis or every third year to defer the entry into force of certain provisions to a later stage and to exclude the smallest enterprises
following an informal trialogue held on twelve january twenty eleven and further discussions as you mentioned rapporteur a compromise text was agreed between parliament and the council
in particular the council agreed to an additional demand from parliament of having the variable concerning the accessibility of tourist accommodation for persons with reduced mobility included in the regulation
all amendments in the report and the compromise text are acceptable to the commission
therefore i would like to thank you mr simpson and the shadow rapporteurs and the members of the committee on transport and tourism for your constructive work on the proposal
following fruitful cooperation between all three institutions i believe that we have now reached our objective which is the establishment of a common framework for the systematic development production and dissemination of european statistics on tourism
