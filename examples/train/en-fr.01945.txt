mr president i want to congratulate elizabeth jeggle for her work on this issue of testing and the use of animals
i voted in favour of this because i believe it is the most pragmatic solution to a problem that we have in updating the nineteen eighty-six legislation
can i say that this is important for animal welfare but also for the continuation of research in the european union
we risk pushing scientists and research into medical conditions outside our borders where there is less regulation so while we do need to improve the regulation and indeed the welfare of animals used in testing in research institutions and universities we also need to guarantee that the research can continue
we talk all the time about encouraging young people into science and spending more on research and innovation and this does involve the use of animals
but let us protect them to the best possible extent and we will do that with this legislation
