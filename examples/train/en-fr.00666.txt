mr president i voted in favour of mr czes≈Çaw siekierski's report and our resolution on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the community
the report and resolution are of great importance in the context of the financial crisis and economic recession
growing poverty in the eu when in some countries poverty affects around twenty of the population clearly shows that the need for food assistance is quite high
under the present circumstances i fully support the european parliament's position that the eu food distribution programme which allocates nearly half a billion euros with the aim of diminishing malnutrition and poverty in the eu should be fully funded by the community
i would especially like to stress the importance of the commission's proposal to improve the structure for selecting products supplied under the programme
the food should be chosen by member states authorities and distributed in cooperation with civil society partners
