madam president throughout the history of estonia we have struggled to maintain the language of the indigenous people
after restoring our independence in nineteen ninety-one we finally enjoyed the liberty to speak our language and treasure our culture and identity
it pains me to see the people of tibet repressed and their language identity culture and religion condemned to extinction
the people's republic of china prc is using the same method of achieving marginalisation of tibetans that the soviet union used on estonians
the sinicisation of tibet just like the russification of estonia during the soviet occupation is being carried out by relocating non-indigenous people to the established territory of the indigenous people
as long as the han chinese population of tibet is increasing the tibetans have every right to feel intimidated
the intention of the chinese authorities to introduce mandarin chinese as the primary language of instruction in schools violates the rights of the indigenous people of tibet
i would like to see that violation brought up and resolved as a priority item within eu policy towards the prc
