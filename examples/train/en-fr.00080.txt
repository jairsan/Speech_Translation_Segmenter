mr president i would just like to show some solidarity coming from an island nation where in our peripheral regions the fishing community is extremely important the culture the traditions and skills and where in these regions alternative industry and alternative ways of life or occupations are extremely difficult to attract
if we can show that solidarity towards the peripheral regions in europe what must we show to the outermost regions which are at the extreme edge of peripherality if you like
i would like to support the case made here to support the skills traditions and culture of the fishing communities in these outermost regions and in very isolated often very small island communities in the peripheral areas of the eu
i would like to support what colleagues have said and i would urge commissioner borg to ensure that if it is a question of an extension of state aid in terms of timelines for renewal of fishing fleets whatever needs to be done let us be as generous as we possibly can
