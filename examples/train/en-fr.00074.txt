mr president i would just briefly like to reply to that because i think it is a matter of courtesy as well as political interest for the council to be here and i am sure they can spare one minister to be present
we have had previous debates in the past two months where the council was present but left the debate half-way through
i think that is unacceptable and it is not for me to report that to my group
it is for the presidency of this house to transmit our discontent to the presidency of the european union
