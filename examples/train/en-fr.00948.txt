mr president just very briefly this is all new to me and i found the discussion very stimulating and educational
when lady ashton first spoke i thought this was a fantastic deal for the european union and i wondered if there were any benefits in it for korea
then speaker after speaker gave the opposite view so i hope that the questions put and the points made by mr arif mr theurer mr campbell bannerman and other speakers could be answered specifically by lady ashton when she replies and also she might tell us if there are any other negotiations going on right now with specific asian countries for bilateral agreements and also how far they have progressed
