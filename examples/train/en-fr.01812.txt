i think we all agree on the need for sound economic governance
but let us be honest about what is happening
what we have seen is blatant flouting of the stability and growth pact rules and engagement in what we would call probably rather euphemistically off-balance-sheet activities and financial engineering
now i am sure we can all agree that the eu member states must adhere to the principles of sound monetary policy fiscal responsibility and honest accounting but do you see this as an opportunity for the eu to gain power over member state budgets or will you tackle the real problem of countries that have cooked the books and amassed massive budget deficits rather than focusing on increasing power over member state budgets
