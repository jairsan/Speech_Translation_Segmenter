mr president this is very much about parliament being before or after before the summit meeting or after the summit meeting
it is very much about trying to exert influence or to limit ourselves to making a comment afterwards
it is fair to say that in ukraine some things are developing in the right direction but there are a lot of things that are moving on the wrong track and if they continue they will move ukraine further from european cooperation
when we raise worries and concerns we are not trying to raise obstacles we are trying to get rid of them and that is why we want the resolution to be adopted now
we know that in ukrainian society and in the ukrainian government there is a keen interest in listening to what the european parliament has to say on these matters
if we speak out they will listen and be aware
if we do not speak out they will note that as well
that is why we favour a decision on the resolution at this part-session
