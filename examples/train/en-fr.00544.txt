madam president on behalf of my group i would like to thank my colleague andreas schwab for handling a very complex dossier very skilfully
we should also perhaps say in the absence of council that the negotiations there have been tough but fair and we have a very good outcome
i would like to pick up on a number of points built on what the commissioner said
i am privileged to have been part of the cars twenty-one initiative from the very beginning and we are now seeing the impact of that integrated approach
this is important terminology and a classic example of how a number of different provisions have been brought together in a rolling update of the regulatory framework affecting motor vehicles but one which the industry is expecting
we set down a road map in cars twenty-one about the environmental and safety challenges that we expected the industry to meet and the crucial thing there is to give them stability and knowledge so that they can plan and design their new products in a sensible and sequenced way albeit with demanding deadlines and targets
we do not want to resile from those challenging targets but to give them that stability
as g√ºnter verheugen pointed out with the industry in such a dire position at the moment because of a lack of demand that regulatory stability is crucially important
i would like to highlight two points
firstly the agreement to bring in electronic stability control systems at the earliest possible date is a very major contribution to safety and i very much welcome that
those of us who have had the opportunity to test those systems will understand their efficiency
secondly i want to highlight issues around the international framework the repeal of the eu directives and their incorporation into national legislation
i welcome that but i think it is now more important than ever commissioner that that process becomes much more transparent about the line the commission is taking on negotiating those directives which are being done in another body a un body and not within this house
