mr president first of all i would like to thank both rapporteurs for their work on this difficult dossier
it is clear that this package and in particular the issue of lifting cabotage restrictions has divided opinion along national lines but i think what we have before us now is an agreement that we can support
i had serious concerns about full cabotage delivered in one move without any levelling-up of social costs or indeed running costs for individual hauliers
such a move i believe would have had a detrimental effect on the road haulage business not only in my own country but in other member states as well
therefore the compromise introducing temporary cabotage is not only sensible it is a solution that will be workable allowing three domestic journeys after one international one
temporary cabotage also allows us to end the environmental nonsense of hgvs travelling hundreds of kilometres empty without distorting domestic markets
finally i am also happy to support the new enforcement measures that have been introduced via the <unk> report
this has to go hand in hand with further market opening and will allow member states to practise tough and efficient enforcement measures
