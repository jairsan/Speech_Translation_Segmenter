mr president like my colleagues i want to thank the commissioner and the rapporteur for their work on this
indeed the commission will remember back in january when i and one of my former colleagues colm burke met him to try and kick-start the globalisation fund for the workers in dell
i think it is a clear indication of how much we at european union level put in with regard to treating people first ensuring that the people are at the core of what the policies are trying to ensure that their lives are protected and when there is trouble or difficulty that the european union can respond quickly
on a personal level i want to thank the commissioner personally for his active involvement in this not just here in parliament or with me personally but also for going to limerick and meeting the workers
and if i could say to other colleagues who occasionally try to raise red herrings with regard to other issues that the globalisation fund for all its faults is a positive from the european union and one that we should be encouraging to grow and to prosper and most importantly of all to go back to the old saying give a man a fish you feed him for a day teach a man to fish he can feed himself for life
that is what the globalisation fund allows us to do
