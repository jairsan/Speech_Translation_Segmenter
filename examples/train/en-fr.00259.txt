mr president you are too kind and i hope you do not live to regret that one day british conservatives abstained in the votes concerning the illustrious euro
we do this because we believe it is an honourable position for those who do not wish to join the currency to leave decisions about that currency to the countries that are in it
however over the past few months it has become increasingly obvious that some quite senior members of this house choose not to act in honourable or respectful ways
recent actions by some of our group leaders when visiting the president of the czech republic fell well short of the respect that should have been shown to the president of a democratic european country
as the european elections draw near many members present here will moan that they feel they are not being taken seriously or given the respect they deserve by their voters
perhaps they should reflect on the point that you can only earn respect if you also choose to show it especially to those who have a principled view that you disagree with
it seems that old revolutionaries never die they just forget what they were fighting for
