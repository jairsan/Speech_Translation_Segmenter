last week the european climate foundation launched its roadmap twenty fifty
this plan shows three pathways by which the european union could cut its co emissions by eighty per cent by twenty fifty in line with our kyoto aspirations
we could do it at little more than the cost of business as usual
we could become almost entirely self-sufficient in energy resources and we would see a significant net job creation through the decarbonisation of our economy
but it can only be done at european level
will the commission embrace this roadmap
will it endeavour to give the european union a new Ã©lan in proposing the necessary policy measures
given the opportunities for job creation will you president barroso use the idea to galvanise the member states into the necessary action
