mr president i welcome this timely debate
as a result of the quest for resources and climate change the arctic region is on the brink of a profound change
it is not only the region itself which is likely to be affected but as many here today have recognised also the eu as a whole
against the background of these developments it is important that the eu approaches the arctic in a comprehensive and strategic manner covering a whole range of issues such as environment transport biodiversity climate change maritime affairs energy and research as well as protection of the livelihood of the indigenous peoples
i consider that the council is now taking this issue very seriously
it broadly supports the suggestions set out in the commission's communication
this should constitute the basis for an arctic policy which needs to be developed in a comprehensive manner
to those who are talking about the new treaty there is no council position at the moment because the council is only now in the process of examining the commission proposals
i would just like to recall the council's conclusions from december
in the conclusion we say that the objectives of the eu could only be achieved in close cooperation with the arctic countries and the eu should enforce its participation in conformity with the current international conventions
as i mentioned earlier the commission proposals are now being studied in much more detail
they will i believe facilitate agreement on an overarching response to the many varied challenges which we face in the arctic region
i welcome the interest of this parliament and i am ready to come back to you to report once the council has reached a position
