madam president one of the achievements of these negotiations has been to establish a funding mechanism for carbon catchment storage demonstration projects and i shall refer to this later
but while i have been ccs negotiator rapporteur it has been through revision of the ets directive that we have achieved success
i have been at best a back-seat driver
sometimes you need luck and i think i have been lucky in having linda mcavan lena ek and others shadow rapporteurs on the ets directive
i think i have been lucky in having a presidency that was open to explore new ideas and i have been particularly lucky in being able to work with avril doyle the rapporteur for this legislation who has achieved an enormous amount
i would just point out one thing mr president which is that there have not been many rapporteurs in the history of this parliament who have tabled an initial proposal that would at best have raised eur one point five billion worth of funding and ended up with a package worth five or six times that much
