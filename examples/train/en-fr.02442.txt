mr president i too would like to thank the commissioner for his contribution to this debate
however because of the concerns that have been raised maybe one solution could be that the national registry of blood banks could be used as the registrar the resource for maintaining the cord stem cells for future use
this would overcome some of the problems and difficulties some of my colleagues have already mentioned with regard to the cost of storage
as well as that we already have a system in place within the existing national blood banks that can regulate and control the quality of that supply
that could be a good way of overcoming some of the difficulties
i like many colleagues believe that the use of stem cells has a huge potential for future disease treatments
however we must also be cautious about giving false hope because too often we have heard not just with stem cells but also with biotechnology in other areas of people being given false hope
we need core scientific values and core scientific research to ensure that the results that are being proclaimed can actually be delivered
