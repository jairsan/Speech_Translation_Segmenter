madam president the most important conclusion from the council meeting was not headline-sexy
it said that the single market has a key role to play to deliver growth
but is this all talk
on economic governance i already see colleagues wanting to water down the stability pact and when it comes to supporting businesses we are not much better
meps flock to sign up to campaigns for cyclists and horse welfare but when it came to campaigning to cut red tape for small businesses only a third of us joined in and there was only one uk labour signature
the commission promises to unlock venture capital which is laudable but almost laughable given that it spent all of last year trying to legislate it out of the market altogether
it is time to walk the walk
nine heads of state have signed a letter on specific actions for business trade innovation and investment
they call on us to choose growth
i certainly do
