madam president the presidents of the council and the commission spoke of the euro plus pact and of the single market
i have a question about each
do they agree with the president of the european central bank that a far larger european stability mechanism will be needed
if they do not agree is it simply because true professionals can rarely admit in public what they know to be true in private
the only participant in the single market which implements the rules one hundred is norway
since the real stress test in the crisis we face will not be of any bank or any nuclear installation but of the solidarity of european union member states do the presidents of the commission and council believe that there are good chances of greater solidarity than we have seen in the past
