mr president sam rainsy is a colleague of ours a member of the parliament in cambodia
that mere fact has led to assassination attempts and a number of political and legal attacks by the ruling party including a twelve year prison sentence
the ruling party apparently does not like the fact that sam rainsy denounces corruption and human rights abuses
i would like to remind this ruling party that the eu is the single largest donor institution to cambodia and that this aid is conditional on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
in two thousand and six sam rainsy received the prize for freedom from liberal international
he received this prize for the defence of freedoms we share across this parliament
we therefore call on the cambodian authorities to implement the recommendations of the un special rapporteur for human rights in cambodia
