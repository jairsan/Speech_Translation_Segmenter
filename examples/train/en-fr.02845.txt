the recent g eight summit wanted it to be known that it was providing usd forty billion to egypt and tunisia for overthrowing dictatorships and embracing democracy
however the g eight statement said that it would support countries in the region that move towards not just democracy but also a market economy
it wants these countries to reap the benefits of globalisation and to engage in investment integration which means making it easier for g eight countries to make money in these countries and then take the money out again
i would not object to recipients of aid being expected to implement and retain democratic institutions and procedures
that would be quite right
however is it not sinister that recipients should be told which economic policies they should choose and which they should discard
surely donors have no right to instruct these new democracies as to which democratic choices they should make
