mr president i think all of those who have spoken have spoken very much in strong terms in favour of the defence of democracy and constitutional order throughout latin america
in that of course there is a condemnation of what happened
whatever the background we do not send in the military to arrest the elected president of a country and send him abroad
irrespective of the background we must be very clear on this we are very clear on this
but then in order to resolve the situation there must be some sort of accommodation some sort of compromise
judging from what i have heard from mr salafranca and others everyone agrees that president arias is probably the man best suited to achieve that particular compromise
he will probably have to spend quite some time in negotiating with representatives of both the parties but i think it is important that he has our support as well as the support of the other american states for these particular efforts
as to the nature of the particular solution that is for him to judge and for them to agree
but clearly on the basis of what i said initially the restoration of constitutional order is what we seek
the return of president zelaya is a necessity when it comes to the restoration of constitutional order
it is probably not sufficient and in all probability there are going to be other elements in bringing about a full restoration of constitutional order
so what we are calling for in the form of the restoration and return of president zelaya is a necessary but in all probability not sufficient part of the restoration of constitutional order which is of key importance for our relationship with honduras for the development of honduras and for the credibility of constitutional order and democracy in that part of the world
