mr president looking back four years to the launching of the alde campaign europe for patients i have good reasons to welcome the agreement reached with the council in december
i would firstly like to congratulate our rapporteur mrs grossetÃªte as well as the other shadows for their good cooperation and the great work accomplished and also the father of this initiative our colleague mr john bowis
the parliament remained united and stayed firm during the negotiations with the council
we stood for patients and for the first time there will be a clear legislative framework in the eu for patients seeking treatment in another member state
we have to consider the agreement reached as a small step but it is a real achievement for patients in europe which will strengthen their rights while focusing on their needs the information available to them and the quality and safety of care
i am sure however that parliament would have supported a more ambitious result
though i recognise the need for member states to be able to set up prior authorisation to maintain the sustainability of their health systems i regret that they including the belgian presidency have sometimes put organisational considerations above patients interests and needs
but we represent our citizens and are responsible for representing them here in this house
let me just mention one example quality and safety
while member states were keen on establishing quality and safety risks as a criterion for the refusal of prior authorisation they have been reluctant to accept and have opposed any system for the sharing of information and upgrading of requirements in this field at eu level
the alde group welcomes the future directive but we will be strict about its implementation and make sure proper reporting and monitoring is in place to ensure that the directive is correctly implemented and that the prior authorisation and reimbursement provisions do not become an unjustified obstacle to patients
finally let me highlight one of my regrets the lack of ambition of the provisions agreed for cooperation in the field of e-health again due to strong opposition from the most advanced member states in this area
the initial proposal from the commission has been significantly watered down
i would therefore like to ask mr dalli the following question
would the commission consider the development of a stand-alone proposal on e-health fostering cooperation and enabling interoperability of data and safety for patients thus making it a reality in europe
