madam president this crisis highlights the importance of making the eu more energy-independent but while we are discussing energy supply we must not forget the fundamental importance of also controlling energy demand
we have a twenty -by twenty twenty eu energy efficiency improvement target and a number of pieces of legislation focussed on energy saving
these energy efficiency actions will not only help to tackle climate change and fuel poverty they will also very significantly improve europe's energy security
there is of course a good reason why the commission's action plan on energy efficiency has an international element to it and recognises the importance of encouraging energy efficiency improvements in countries outside europe not least countries supplying and transiting energy to europe
the fact is if they use less we are likely to get more
that is important above and beyond the immediate political side to this crisis
