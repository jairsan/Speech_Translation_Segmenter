madam president parliament's demand to maintain if not increase the agricultural budget is in my view highly optimistic
these are tough times and budgets are not limitless
in my view these proposals will need a reality check when the overall eu budget is determined some time next year
we have to get back to the real priorities of the common agricultural policy
food security food safety biodiversity climate change new technologies and creating a viable competitive market-led industry have to be the focus
in my view the commission's proposals have lost the direction which we had from the previous two reports
they lack focus and they are too complicated
i am happy to say that in his proposals albert dess has set out a very sensible framework in which we can develop future reform
