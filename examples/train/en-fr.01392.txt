mr president women represent half of europe's talent
we must not waste this creative potential
if we succeed in channelling this potential into the economy we will make a huge leap forward with regard both to the attitudes still present in european societies and to the union's new agenda for more growth jobs and competitiveness
equal opportunities do exist on paper
the union has produced at least thirteen directives on gender equality
the principle is anchored in the treaty and in the constitutions and legislative acts of member states but the real-life data speaks a different language
never before were women so well educated but when it comes to entrepreneurship women are still largely under-represented
on the gender pay gap virtually nothing has moved in recent years
when doing business women rarely default when it comes to reimbursing their loans but access to finance is more difficult for women and this is determined by the banks quest for collateral
you need to have more money in order to borrow money but only one of the world's assets are owned by women
despite higher qualifications despite higher education women remain totally under-represented among decision makers
getting more women into decision-making positions is the key to everything
women can promote their case and market their agenda but the real power lies in decision making and that is why women ought to take part
critical mass is essential to bring about change
one single woman in a decision-making body will soon have to adapt her behaviour to be accepted by the male majority
as a starter having a few women on a decision-making board could already make a difference yet all these strategies will help little if we do not succeed in removing the biggest obstacle for women reconciling family and working life
remaining obstacles call for a policy response and that is why we still need policies geared towards gender both at national and european level
