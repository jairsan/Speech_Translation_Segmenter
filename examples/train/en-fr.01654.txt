mr president i would like to just take an opportunity to clear up one or two questions which have arisen although it is a pity that some of those asking the questions are not around for the answers
asylum obligations are clearly set out under international conventions which all member states have individually signed up to
that is not the same as an immigration policy and people really should recognise the difference
for those who are concerned about the money if i may make a party political and national political point here if certain of our member states stopped creating asylum seekers from iraq and afghanistan i am sure we could save a lot more money and indeed save people a lot more misery
as regards some of the other points which were raised it is hoped that improving the quality of the system in certain member states will be able to increase confidence between member states and deblock some of the other parts of the asylum system as well as helping member states feel that there is support when they are facing particular burdens
as others have pointed out while some of our member states do have considerable geographical pressures on them from the flows which arrive many of the over-burdened countries are actually not in the european union at all but are elsewhere
i was very interested to hear a colleague arguing for additional support out there in terms of the asylum support office but i am afraid i missed the amendments which he tabled on that topic
i also want to be clear that the asylum support office is not there to determine status it is not taking over the role of member states in that field
all in all i welcome the kind comments made by colleagues i welcome the active involvement of those who have helped me very much on this report and i am sure that we are all looking forward or most of us anyway to being there in valletta when the ribbon is cut on the asylum support office and we can begin work
