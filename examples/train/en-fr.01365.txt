mr president the prime minister spoke in his opening remarks about the need for europe to develop a more effective foreign policy especially with regard to its near neighbours amongst which we must include israel
here we have a country which is in military occupation of another people's territory which infringes human rights which maintains the blockade of gaza and applies collective punishment to one and a half million people and yet we regard it as a normal trading partner
our principles and our policies are clear they were restated by foreign ministers just last month but our words do not seem to be backed up by any deeds
i think the true test of this presidency over the next few months will be whether we start to apply some independence in our relations with israel and whether we start to demonstrate that our principles mean something and that we will apply them
