mr president six months ago the world was shocked by the death and destruction visited by israel upon gaza
now the cameras have gone away yet the economic siege continues
less than one quarter of the materials and supplies needed by the people there are getting through the checkpoints just eighteen items in all
nothing for reconstruction nothing for business nothing that creates jobs or offers hope
israel is in effect keeping one and a half million people in a form of prison camp surrounded by walls patrolled by armed guards
mr president i ask you to convey to the president that he should visit gaza at the earliest opportunity to judge the situation for himself
if he believes that such collective punishment cannot be acceptable he should speak out on behalf of the innocent
