mr president on seven december the unhcr expressed concern that some two hundred and fifty eritrean refugees are being held in sinai by bedouin smugglers
we are aware that these refugees were compelled to pay a specific amount of money for their wish to live in better conditions
reportedly the refugees are kept in containers in the desert and are often beaten
the attitude of the eritrean government itself is alarming instead of protecting its citizens it considers them unwanted dissidents
we call for rapid and joint action primarily by egypt and israel to stop the traffickers to dismantle this organised crime network and certainly to strengthen efforts to protect current and future refugees by implementing unhcr provisions and standards
