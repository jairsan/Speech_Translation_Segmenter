mr president could i say on behalf of the alde group that we would support mrs doyle's proposition
i think it has much merit
the house had a resolution on this issue in october of last year
to a certain extent we are repeating what we said then but we are also saying some things that are rather stronger and as mrs doyle said they come at a critical moment when most of us in this house would want to see the eu take up a seat on the arctic council and we would not wish to compromise that
it would be much better to refer this back to committee and have a full and considered report in the new mandate
