mr president i speak on behalf of my group when i say that we are in a very difficult situation practically and politically in which member states have been talking about completing an asylum package since nineteen ninety-nine
if there is a political imperative then it is today with north africa and the mediterranean in crisis
talking about burden sharing should now lead to a practical and sensitive proposal
on behalf of my group i want to say that sylvie guillaume has prepared in cooperation as mrs hohlmeier said with all the shadows a proposal which is both sensitive and effective and really provides as the commissioner said a cornerstone of the asylum package
this is why the vote on wednesday is so vitally important
if we can repeat the majority that we achieved in committee we can reach a position of completing an asylum package which pays attention to the many concerns and sensitivities across this house
if i can give you one example i dealt with refugee cases for many years as an asylum lawyer and i know that the enemy of good asylum procedure fair just effective asylum procedure accepted by most members states is the lack of front-loading of asylum cases
the fact that there is poor quality decision making right across the european union in many member states leads to higher costs for member states not lower costs
so when member states talk about the financial implications they should understand that quality of decision making getting it right the first time and ensuring that the appeals procedure works effectively is where we save money and where we are fair and just
if any member doubts that this report is an effective fair and just report they should look at these procedures very carefully and understand that much work has gone into dealing with many of the potentially controversial aspects
it is also important to stress that the debate should not just be about cost it is about harmonising practices across the eu
it is clear that standards vary too much between member states
if we are going to continue with this kind of asylum lottery we are not paying attention to the realities of asylum numbers going up
as we know those asylum numbers have been plummeting for many years
now we are in a more difficult position
the rules in the procedures directive cover perhaps the most complex part of the whole asylum package
that the procedure should be fair and effective can be a matter of life or death for those fleeing persecution
we have to recognise our responsibility in upholding international obligations when dealing with people seeking protection within our borders
therefore i want to congratulate the rapporteur and all the shadows for their dedicated efforts towards reaching a strong position in parliament
let us repeat the vote that we had in committee
let us ensure that we send a strong signal to the commission but mainly to the member states that we are serious in this parliament about completing the asylum package in a way that will be acceptable to many right across the house
