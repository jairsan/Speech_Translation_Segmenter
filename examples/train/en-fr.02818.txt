mr president my own constituency has a long history of combining the promotion of the welsh language to the young generation with artistic and technical talents to produce animated programmes like sally mally super ted and sam t√¢n
today this past has been reinvigorated by new productions such as dr who and torchwood so that wales is quickly becoming known as a centre for cultural excellence with regard to film and programme production as well as being home to newer creative areas like the hugely profitable gaming industry
in order for this to continue the most important thing we must now do is to provide the support that our creative industries need to continue to grow
we must focus on reducing the administrative hurdles that all small businesses face and look at ways to get real added value from the single market via cooperation on intellectual property rights a european patent and realising the full potential of the digital agenda and of course eliminating inconsistencies in existing eu legislation such as in the field of vat
our eu budget should be used productively to develop the huge amount of creative energy around us into true wealth-creating businesses providing sustainable jobs and a prosperous and rich future for our people in wales and beyond
