mr president eu funds distributed by the lottery of first come first served is wrong
yet that is what we have seen in northern ireland this week
the minister who decided on cavalier distribution of eu rural development funds on this basis leading to the demeaning and bizarre spectacle of farmers queuing for two days to get some of their own modulated money back is a minister not fit to hold office
in that at a stroke she both humiliated hard-working farmers and displayed crass ignorance of basic requirements for the distribution of eu funds
the source of this embarrassment is the wanton refusal of the minister to allocate sufficient funds to rural development
the pitiful gbp fifty million she put into axis one and only gbp fifteen million of that into the modernisation fund is what caused the spectacle of tuesday
let me say on another matter in defence of mr wilson the minister of the environment in northern ireland that i am glad he does not fit the stereotype that unthinking climate-change hysterics expect in this house
