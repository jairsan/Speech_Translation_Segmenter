madam president it is fair to say that the telecoms sector is a success story within the eu which makes it all the more important that we set the right regulatory framework
i should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their work and in particular my colleague pilar del castillo vera on making big improvements to the commission proposal for the regulators by turning it into this body of european regulators for electronic communications berec
it is a pity that a debate about the internet and internet censorship and the legal powers of member states has distracted attention from the substance of this package
i would like to compliment my colleague malcolm harbour for thrashing out a compromise text with the council over this vexed issue known as amendment one hundred and thirty-eight
if nothing else this part of the package has provoked a torrent of e-mail lobbying and i have to say to those people who believe that large volumes of e-mails and many words will prevail that they very quickly become counterproductive
what is easy to send in an instant is equally easy to delete in an instant but unfortunately too much time has to be spent scrolling down trying to find anything else other than spam
i very much hope that the regulators will feel fully equipped to bring about more competition a level playing field and much enhanced consumers rights as well as striking the right balance to encourage investment and innovation to keep europe at the cutting edge
another important aspect of this package is the enhanced consumer rights that have been delivered in particular number portability within one working day and greater transparency in contracts and billing
these are practical matters that are important to the individual consumer
