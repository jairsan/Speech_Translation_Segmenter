mr president i welcome this particular report because the testing of cosmetics is an issue that concerns many of the constituents in my region west midlands and i have received a lot of correspondence on this issue
i welcome this report and supported it because it establishes pan-european standards on the use of potentially harmful materials and sets standards for testing claims that cosmetics manufacturers make but we need similar standards set for claims about animal testing
last time we looked at this report we dealt with the testing on animals for scientific purposes
we now have an important tool in increasing customer awareness of what goes into cosmetics which would only be enhanced by a focus on animal testing
