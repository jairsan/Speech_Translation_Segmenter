mr president at his first press conference as the new president or as the appointee mr van rompuy declared that the copenhagen process would be a step towards the global management of our planet
i cannot be alone in being alarmed at the way in which the environmental agenda is being piggybacked by those who have a different agenda about the shifting of power away from national democracies
environmentalism is too important to be left to just one side of the political debate to apply its solutions
as a conservative i consider myself a natural conservationist
it was marx who taught that nature was a resource to be exploited a doctrine that found brutal realisation in the smokestack industries of the comecon states but we have never tried the free market solutions of extending property rights of having clean air and clean water by allowing ownership rather than the tragedy of the commons where you expect state action and global technocracies to achieve these ends
environmentalism is altogether too important to be left
