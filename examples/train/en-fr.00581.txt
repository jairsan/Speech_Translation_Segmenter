i would like to thank the president-in-office for the detailed and technical response but let me give you a practical example which may focus your mind
in a few years the european union will ban the production of eggs from caged systems
however the system will still be used outside of our borders and we will import liquid egg or powdered egg from those cages that are banned in the european union and producers wonder at the logic of all of that
i ask you as a man who is quite logical and detailed in your responses how do you argue the case for that type of system unless we say that you cannot import the liquid egg or the powdered product coming from a caged system
it is ridiculous to ban it internally
