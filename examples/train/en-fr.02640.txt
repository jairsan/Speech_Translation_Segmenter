madam president i had intended to speak on the impact of the financial crisis in the republic of ireland on the economy in northern ireland
instead it is with deep regret that i inform this house of the callous and brutal murder of a member of the police service of northern ireland
twenty-five-year-old constable ronan kerr died at the hands of republican terrorists on saturday afternoon
constable kerr a catholic police officer was murdered when a booby-trap bomb planted under his car exploded on saturday as he left for work
he died at the scene
i call on this house to condemn this atrocity and to call for an end to such violent acts at the hands of irish republican terrorists intent on dragging northern ireland back to its darker days and derailing the political process
since two thousand and seven dissident republican terrorists have planted dozens of booby-trap bombs under the private cars of police officers
thankfully most of these have failed to detonate
i am sure that you will also join with me in calling for all information regarding this murder to be given to the police
there are people in the local community who have information about constable kerr's brutal murder
they need to come forward and bring these murderers to justice not shield them from it
they need to do it for the future of our country and out of respect for a brave police officer and his grieving mother and family
i am also appalled at the lack of respect that this speech has been given by some members of this house
