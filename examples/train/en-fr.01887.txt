mr president i declare an interest as a working farmer
plans for the future of the cap have to work at a practical level and it must be affordable
the military have a phrase no names no pack-drill however a member of the ppe group voted against this report in committee
this may be because in today's financial climate cost is a worry and the report's enthusiasm for non-agricultural objectives under pillar two diverts funds away from farmers
the report's obsession with climate change could lead to accepting advice that obliges arable farmers to pump tractor exhaust under the ground increasing fuel consumption and spoiling seabeds as a consequence
my own experience of witnessing contractors attempts to inject dirty water under the ground to satisfy eu rules tells me what problems lie ahead
ruminant livestock farmers may be required to reduce methane emissions by replacing hay and silage with more expensive cereal-based rations
if there has to be a cap let it assist farmers and not hinder them
