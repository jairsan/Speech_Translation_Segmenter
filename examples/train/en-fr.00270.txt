mr president carbon capture and storage has become a central feature of this debate on fighting climate change and i am certainly also in favour of exploring and developing this technology
if it is successful it will one day have a significant role to play and we do need a strong legal framework to make sure it is properly regulated
but ccs cannot be used as an excuse to carry on building more dirty coal plants which will produce more co
the only way to move forward with ccs research without allowing this to happen is by adopting a clear emissions performance standard and that is why the verts ale group has tabled an amendment to control the level of emissions from new fossil-fuel power stations
in other words only the most efficient power stations could be built whatever the fuel and it was the inclusion of this clause which was the essential motive for our group voting for this in the committee
we are disappointed that many other good points included by the committee have been lost during negotiations including stronger liability and monitoring transport and the exclusion of enhanced oil recovery
there has been tremendous pressure to come to a conclusion on this but it has to be the right conclusion and for us that certainly means including an emissions performance standard
