mr president to many colleagues a target of a ninety-five reduction in co emissions by twenty fifty may seem extreme but if we are to accept as i do the peer-reviewed science as represented by the latest ipcc report that level of reduction will be required if we are to keep the two c increase in global warming in our sights
secondly while i voted against a range of nuclear-related amendments due to my ongoing concerns with nuclear fission i have no problem with references to research on safety issues or on new generations of nuclear energy
like many i watch and wonder as to whether nuclear fusion will ever become a reality
the third point i would like to put on the record is my ongoing concern with the irish situation and the lack of transparent and real ownership unbundling of our electricity grid which remains a major disincentive to investment by other producers especially using alternative fuels with the result that the irish have one of the highest electricity costs in europe
