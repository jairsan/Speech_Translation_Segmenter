first of all i thank the presidency for its reply and indeed commend the french presidency for its initiative on mobility
however your response quotes a letter here from the european commission which is nothing more than a red herring because it says that the emphasis was put on the diversity of legal status and the lack of harmonised criteria for identifying non-profit activities in the different countries
minister you are very well aware that thirty-two countries already produce these npis including i am delighted to say france and the czech republic who will be holding the presidency of the council from january
so i believe that the commission is as i said introducing red herrings and dragging its heels on this and given that france is itself producing these accounts i would be very pleased to hear that you would at least recommend to eurostat that they recommend to all eu countries that they produce these accounts
