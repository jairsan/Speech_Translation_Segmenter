madam president i will be very brief
somalia is a big problem
it has been a big problem for twenty years
we discussed piracy
but let us not forget the humanitarian situation which is a disaster
let us not forget the problem of terrorists
let us not forget the region's instability
over time we need to try and deal with it all
but let us also be realistic
the international community the united nations and others have been struggling with somalia for a very long time
results have been fairly limited
we are fairly late entrants in this area when it comes to trying to deal with somalia
we are trying to do certain things
in atalanta we all claimed it a success but let us not think that it can solve all the problems
when we are discussing extending it out into the indian ocean we are talking about absolutely enormous areas
and even if we were to deploy all of the naval assets of all of the countries of the european union i would not be certain of absolute success
and some of these pirates are of course fed money as well which makes it possible for them to invest in further resources
that makes the problem rather challenging
that is not the reason for not doing what we can do
with the reservation of all of the difficulties we should try to engage in supporting the transitional federal government
that is what we are trying to do with different training programmes
is there a guarantee of this being successful
no there is not
but the only thing that we can be absolutely certain of is that if we do not even try we are absolutely certain not to succeed
if we try at least there is the possibility of us making a positive impact
and if we have received nothing else we have managed to secure the programmes of the deliveries of the world food programme to the starving and suffering people of somalia
that in itself is something to be proud of
