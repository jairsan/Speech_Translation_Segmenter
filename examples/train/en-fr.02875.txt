madam president i would like to ask mr kirkhope this question because he agrees that the european arrest warrant needs review and re-evaluation my view would be a lot stronger than that but never mind
he mentioned the european investigation order and i believe he was saying that this could be a step too far
but is he aware that in his own government one of the first acts of the home secretary theresa may when coming into office was to opt into the european investigation order which means we now cannot opt out and will be stuck with whatever comes through the legislative sausage machine because this will be subject to qualified majority voting and the final outcome is something we cannot determine
is this another case of tory double-speak where they speak out against the acts of the european union here but endorse them back home in our own parliament
