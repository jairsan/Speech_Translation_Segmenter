i was wondering if the commissioner is satisfied that enough action is being taken by member states in relation to implementing existing legislation and regulation
i had my own experience in acting in a legal capacity where a very serious accident occurred and even twelve months after the accident the shipping company still had not complied with the regulations that were then in place and had been in place for over three years
