mr paleckis i am convinced that the bonus article one hundred and sixty-nine initiative is expected to substantially improve the effectiveness of environmental and sustainable development policies for the entire baltic region
it would in particular greatly contribute to the implementation of mainly the environmental part of the european union strategy for the baltic sea region that the commission is planning to present to the european council in june two thousand and nine
we are now moving ahead swiftly with the preparation of this legislative proposal on an article one hundred and sixty-nine and have included bonus one hundred and sixty-nine in our legislative programme for two thousand and nine
we are making every effort to table a legislative proposal as soon as we possibly can in two thousand and nine
however the timing of the legislative proposal is not entirely in our hands it also depends on the timely and successful response by the bonus consortium in revising the tentative action plan
if the latter reaches the commission by the beginning of june this was agreed by the bonus consortium then i am quite confident that the legislative proposal can be tabled still under the mandate of the current commission
