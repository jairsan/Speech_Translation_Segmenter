madam president the relentless increase in the price of oil and its consequent upward pressure on fertiliser prices together with swingeing increases in the price of wheat maize and other cereals is creating a crisis in our farm sector as well as a growing global crisis
it is worth remembering that the uprising in tunisia which set off the domino effect across the entire middle east began with the self-immolation of a poor street food trader
europe's farmers can make a positive intervention in helping to resolve this crisis if they are provided with the appropriate tools
it is time we grasped the opportunities provided by biotechnology to help us meet growing demand for quality food products
more than one hundred and twenty-five million hectares of gm crops are being grown commercially worldwide by more than thirteen million farmers and yet we do not mention biotechnology in this resolution
wake up and smell the coffee europe before we have food riots on our streets
