mr president the commission is fully aware of the outgoing brazilian president's recent decision to refuse extradition of an italian citizen mr battisti sentenced in absentia to a life sentence and several other terms of prison by the italian court
i have taken due note of your views on this particular case and i share your feelings towards the victims and their families
however the commission considers that there is no scope for its involvement in this case
the european union has not concluded any extradition agreement with brazil and even if this had been the case it would have no right to intervene in individual extradition cases
a decision on extradition between european union member states or between european union member states and third states are entirely the preserve of the judiciary
italy's relations with brazil on criminal cooperation are governed by a bilateral extradition treaty concluded in nineteen eighty-nine
the brazilian authorities have used their discretionary power within the law to refuse extradition of mr battisti
i would like to add in no uncertain terms in the case of extradition i have no doubts that italian justice delivers the high standards expected of european union member states
