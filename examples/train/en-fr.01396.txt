mr president i voted against the commission because i do not want to be governed by a european commission of any composition but there are particular reasons for voting against this one
a number of its members were members of the communist party or were associated with it
for example they include mr barroso mr šefčovič mr füle mr piebalgs and mr potočnik to name just a few
baroness ashton was treasurer of the campaign for nuclear disarmament which was little better than a communist-front organisation and a proportion of its funding came from the soviet bloc
she is not fit to be responsible for foreign security and defence policy
the noble baroness worked to undermine the defence policy of her own country when we faced the gravest threat a nuclear threat from our enemies
the commission is the new de facto government of the european union
europe is sleep-walking towards disaster
we are now governed by communists collaborators and quislings
