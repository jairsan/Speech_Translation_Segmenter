mr president thank you very much for offering me the opportunity to give my explanation of vote on this particularly important issue
like the previous speakers i note the duplicity with which those who support the european project often operate
we were told for example that the lisbon treaty would fall if any country voted against it
when the french and dutch duly voted no we were told that actually most countries want it to continue so we should continue
when the irish rejected it rather than simply accepting this as the final nail in the coffin of the lisbon treaty we were told that we must find a way to make the irish vote again until they vote the right way
here is yet another example
we were told that the lisbon treaty is completely different to the constitution
look at the evidence they say we have changed the font size we have moved it around it is completely different and we have stripped out the symbols of the european union
we warned that this would not last for long
those who support the project would find a way of reintroducing the symbols
this is exactly what has been done
my plea to those of you who support the european project is to be honest with the electorate and have the courage to put it to a referendum
