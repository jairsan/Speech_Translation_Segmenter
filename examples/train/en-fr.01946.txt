mr president i would like to congratulate elizabeth jeggle and all of those involved in reaching this balanced compromise on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes
indeed the european animal welfare movement welcomes the prompt adoption of the agreed compromise
i believe the adopted text will bring about direct and tangible animal welfare benefits while at the same time it will allow essential medical research to continue in europe which hopefully will deliver new innovative and effective treatments
the compromise that we have reached today is also an important step towards harmonising european regulations on animal experimentation and that in itself i think is very important
finally it is a humane response which has established upper threshold limits for pain and it does put an obligation on the commission to inspect animal testing institutions where there is due reason for concern
