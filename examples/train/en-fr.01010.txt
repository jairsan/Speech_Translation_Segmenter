mr president everyone wants energy security so why do we not have it
maybe it is because there are twenty-seven interpretations of what energy security means
personally i interpret it as meaning among other things diversifying the sources and moving away from our gas dependency on russia
we do not have to look too far for evidence of this just at some of our member states which being too far from russia to have a pipeline do not have all the problems attendant on dependency
i think we should focus on lng developing technologies building lng terminals and bringing gas from all over the world
we should also contribute to establishing a global market for lng such as there is for oil and commodities
concerning the nabucco pipeline i think the project should be quickly redesigned to take into consideration gas from various sources and reconsider a shorter route which might lead from georgia ukraine under the black sea to romania
we just have to look at the map
the fact that member states have different interpretations of or interests in energy security is also proven by the fact that some countries involved in nabucco have also signed up for south stream thereby lowering nabucco's credibility and the chances for a common european energy policy
south stream definitely means increasing dependency on russian gas
