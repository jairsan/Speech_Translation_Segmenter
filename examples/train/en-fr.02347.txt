mr president the commission shares the honourable member's view that the implementation of the one hundred and sixteen zero hotline for missing children requires further efforts in many member states
in that respect the revised telecom rules and in particular i refer to article twenty-seven a of the universal service directive require member states to make every effort to ensure that citizens have access to the service operating a hotline to report cases of missing children
in that respect the commission is carefully monitoring and assisting member states in the transposition of that new provision into national law which has to be completed by twenty-five may twenty eleven
on seventeen november last year the commission adopted the communication entitled dial one hundred and sixteen zero the european hotline for missing children
the objectives of the communication are to renew the commission's call on the member states to implement the missing children hotline as a matter of priority and to ensure that the same high quality of service is offered throughout the union to provide practical support to the member states
the communication highlights existing best practice developed by the member states to address the main problems linked to the operating cost and telecom cost of the one hundred and sixteen zero hotline
the commission proposes using this best practice to work out a set of common minimum standards that would guarantee a high quality service throughout the eu so that parents and children can count on the same assistance no matter where they are
this extensive work goes beyond electronic communications issues for which i am responsible and is coordinated by my colleague mrs reding
