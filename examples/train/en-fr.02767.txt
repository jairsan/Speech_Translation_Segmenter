mr president i voted against the report on the eu's common foreign and security policy
i am in complete disagreement with the views and ideas it expresses about europe's current and future role in the world
in a nutshell this report stands for a militarised and imperialist europe
it defends an aggressive raw materials strategy and asks for and i quote a less rigid distinction between military and civilian crisis management operations
this is disguised language for a further militarisation of foreign policy
it welcomes the trade agreement with colombia despite the fact that hundreds of trade unionists have been killed in recent years guilty simply of being trade unionists
this report hypocritically names social unrest as one element of a new generation of security challenges and risks
what hypocrisy the capitalist system has created poverty and misery across the world and is incapable of dealing with the consequences
it is the right of people to defend their legitimate interests and struggle for a better future without any interference from the mighty political economic and military powers
