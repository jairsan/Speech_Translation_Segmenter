madam president i would like to thank you for a very lively and substantive debate on eu enlargement and our strategy now next year and in the near future
this debate has been in line with the best democratic traditions of this parliament and i am grateful for the broad general endorsement of our carefully conducted enlargement policy
you have rightly underlined the importance of simultaneous and parallel commitment and conditionality in eu enlargement
i agree and i want to underline the paramount importance of being both fair and firm at the same time
we have to be fair and respect the commitments we have undertaken to the countries that are covered by our consolidated enlargement agenda in south-eastern europe that is the western balkans and turkey
at the same time we can be as firm and as we are fair and we need to apply rigorous conditionality when dealing with these candidate countries and potential candidates
these only work together in tandem in unison and that is indeed the best recipe for driving reforms and democratic and economic transformation in south-eastern europe
it is also the best recipe for anchoring stability in the western balkans and driving reforms that enhance fundamental freedoms in turkey
i think mrs flautre is right that there cannot be by definition a more attractive portfolio than enlargement
however i am a man of moderation believe it or not and i believe that there are certain limits to how much attraction and fascination a man can take
and as carl requested some work will also be left for my successor for the next commission and for this parliament
be that as it may it has been great to work with you
together we have made a difference
let us recall that eu enlargement has greatly contributed to the fact that europe today is whole and free
let us keep it that way and let us complete our work in south-eastern europe
