mr president just two points that my group thinks are very crucial about the stockholm programme
first we believe that the method of balance very often used in this programme goes a bit in the wrong direction
security to us is only a tool for reaching freedom it is not its opponent
when we are not free we are not secure
we find that balance a bit misleading
then secondly on frontex minister wallstr√∂m what do you actually mean when you talk about strengthening frontex
what do you mean by that
because that has not been clarified in any of the versions of the stockholm programme i have seen
and would you not think that it may be extremely important more important even to strengthen the parliamentary control over frontex and stop frontex from sending back people that might very well have a reason to ask for asylum as frontex has been doing this year
i would prefer to see a strengthening there
i believe that the stockholm programme should serve all the residents of the eu not just a few
