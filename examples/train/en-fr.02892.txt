mr president i would like to agree with the previous speaker
quite often it appears that whatever the problem the answer seems to be from this place more eu and more regulation
harmonisation versus mutual recognition imposed eu contract law that adds an administrative burden to small businesses
but yet what we really should be focusing on is making the eu work better
whatever your views on the eu whether you are sceptical about further integration or you want more europe we should be focusing on making the eu and the internal market work better but also tackling cross-border fraud
for years since i have been an mep i have been receiving letters and e-mails from constituents who have inadvertently been misled into signing up for a business directory then being invoiced for a rather large amount of money
rather than focusing on all the other stuff we focused on this week let us make sure the eu works better
let us focus on reducing the administrative burden for small and medium-sized businesses and let us help eu citizens who have been affected by this cross-border fraud
