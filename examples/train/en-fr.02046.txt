thank you for your response
i was just wondering if you have any proposals or guidelines that you are going to put to member states in order to suggest how they will monitor the working time of self-employed drivers particularly the time they spend cleaning or maintaining their vehicles or doing paperwork related to the job in hand which i believe will be extremely difficult to monitor
also will you be looking at the socio-economic impact on owner-drivers given that their driving time will now be significantly decreased
