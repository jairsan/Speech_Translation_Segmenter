mr president the measures under discussion are part of the existing so-called area of justice freedom and security of which immigration is a part
this is about a common immigration and asylum policy and however much the british government may lie to the british people we know that they intend that britain should eventually be bound by it
but a one-size-fits-all immigration policy will not work for britain
britain is one of the most densely populated countries in the world more densely populated surprisingly than india china or japan
net immigration to britain is now running at about two hundred and thirty zero people per annum adding over a million new people to the population every five years
the population will rise from its current sixty-one point four million an all-time high to about seventy million plus in twenty thirty-one and then spiral ever upwards
all this growth is due to immigration and births to immigrants
the uk independence party is not opposed to some immigration but this should be strictly controlled and for the benefit of britain and not the european union or anybody else
britain does not need a common european immigration policy
what we need to do is end mass immigration now and introduce a strictly limited and controlled immigration policy
we should apply the terms of the nineteen fifty-one convention on refugees which requires them to seek sanctuary in the first designated safe country they come to which is not a little island off the coast of europe called britain
we should end the promotion of multiculturalism which is divisive and a recipe for conflict and assimilate and integrate existing migrants into a common culture with respect for a common set of political and legal institutions
there should be no place in britain and i suggest anywhere in europe for sharia law
