madam president i voted in favour of the dess report but i must say i was disappointed that amendment four was not successful
it was supported by my group because it would have allowed specific aid under the first pillar to compensate for natural handicaps and also to ensure that agricultural activity was maintained in mountainous areas in environmentally sensitive areas and in natura two thousand regions
i voted against amendment twenty-three not because i support gmos i do not but because i support subsidiarity and i believe that member states should be able to make their own choices on gmos
i was particularly pleased that we supported amendment twenty-seven which sensibly rejected the introduction of burdensome and unclear requirements derived from the water framework directive into the cost-compliant system until we have a much clearer picture with regard to its implementation in the various member states
i was also pleased to see parliament support a multi-tiered safety net in the event of market disruption and indeed emergency situations
this is a reasonable and a proportionate response
finally i was pleased that we overwhelmingly voted that the budget be maintained at least at the twenty thirteen level
without that all the rest of it is just talk
