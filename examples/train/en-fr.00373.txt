mr president it is not just the members of this house who have been outraged by developments in gaza
the european public have also been outraged by the suffering of the people in gaza and the israeli blockade for far too long
added to this are the constant attacks and the terrifying israeli military assaults on innocent civilians especially women and children
the calls by the world community for an immediate ceasefire are falling on deaf ears
palestinians need urgent access to food medical aid and security
israel must at the very least respect the principles of international law
unless it does so israel should lose any remaining support it has from the international community
it is unfortunate that the un's resolution has been sidelined
it is also regrettable that the eu still needs to find a role
perhaps it can do so if it takes stronger measures than it has done so far
it is not enough just to put the upgrading of the relationship on ice
we have leverage
we are a major trading partner
we are a major funder in that region
so we are able to exercise that role
