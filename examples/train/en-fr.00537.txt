the question which was asked is very important and i would like to underline that the commission strongly rejects the racism xenophobia and any type of hate speech the honourable member refers to
the commission also shares the concerns raised and is aware that certain content available on the internet can have a very negative impact
the commission fights racism xenophobia and anti-semitism in all media platforms and not just the internet as far as possible under the powers conferred by the treaties
on this basis the commission has taken a number of initiatives legislative and non-legislative which seek to prevent discrimination as well as racist xenophobic and anti-semitic speeches
firstly there is the audiovisual media services directive which extends minimum standards for content to all audiovisual and media services and that includes on-demand offers on the internet
this includes prohibition of incitement to hatred based on race sex religion or nationality
furthermore the commission had adopted policies that aim at reducing racist content online
i would just underline here the recommendation on the protection of minors and human dignity and on the right of reply which calls for action against discrimination in all media
the recently adopted council framework decision on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law sets out a common eu approach to racism and xenophobia
the framework decision aims at criminalising international conduct such as incitement to violence or hate towards a group of people or against a person belonging to a group defined on the basis of race colour descent religion belief or national or ethnic origin
incitement to violence or hatred would also be punishable if committed by public dissemination and distribution of tracts pictures and other materials
the member states have an obligation to comply with those provisions by twenty-eight november twenty ten
apart from this legal approach the commission is promoting a set of measures for the safer use of the internet
i think parliament well knows the safer internet plus programme with a budget of eur fifty-five million for the period two thousand and nine twenty thirteen which co-funds projects with the following objectives increased public awareness provision of a network of contact points for reporting illegal and harmful content and conduct in particular on child sexual abuse material grooming and cyber-bullying fostering of self-regulatory initiatives in this field and involving children in creating a safer online environment establishing a knowledge base of the new trends in the use of online technologies and their consequences for children's lives
the commission furthermore strives to promote a responsible use of media and the internet
in its communication on media literacy of december two thousand and seven the commission calls on member states to commit to more effectively promoting media literacy and research in this field
this year it will present a recommendation on media literacy
it is also worth noting that our neighbour the council of europe has developed a series of international legally binding and non-binding instruments on these issues which all show that cyberspace is not a lawless area and that member states are bound to protect individual rights and freedoms through their national laws the cybercrime convention and its additional protocol three
