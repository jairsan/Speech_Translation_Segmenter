madam president the revision of the multiannual financial framework comes at a time of severe economic and financial crisis in europe
we are not therefore in a position to cover the requirements of the lisbon treaty and the europe twenty twenty strategy
the president of the european commission has dramatically announced that democracy could disappear in greece spain and portugal unless urgent action is taken to tackle the debt crisis
does anybody think that these countries are in a position to finance an increase in the eu budget
does anybody think that the rest of the member states are in a position to bail out these countries and additionally to finance an increase in the eu budget
the answer to both questions is no
some difficult choices will have to be made at this point to allow a reduction in the eu budget
it is now time to get rid of programmes that have not proved efficient of which we have many in the present eu budget
