mr president well it is all terribly simple really isn t it
we have had one vote against the treaty in ireland and one vote for the treaty in ireland so if we have any sort of sporting sense we ought to make this the best of three but the difference is that with a third referendum let's make it a free and a fair referendum
because what has happened in ireland most certainly is not that in fact i hope you are all very proud of yourselves because what you have done is you have taken the littlest boy in the playground got him into the corner and given him a good kicking
this is a victory for the bully boys it is a victory for big money and a victory for bureaucrats
the whole thing was a travesty oh so you respect this vote do you
you did not respect the last vote did you
the european commission poured in millions of pounds of taxpayers money well pounds or euros it doesn t matter though it does in our case because we have still got the pound thank god you poured in millions
something like a factor of between ten one and twenty one was the outspending of the yes <unk> to the no <unk>
the referendum commission in ireland did not do its job did not tell the irish people that of course the lisbon constitutional treaty has profound impacts on their own constitution and perhaps worst of all the broadcasting commission in ireland changed the rules so there was not equal coverage for the yes and the no <unk>
the whole thing was an outrage
but what they did campaign on what you all campaigned on was vote yes for jobs
that was what it was all about
well hot off the press folks aer lingus have laid people off today and intel the people who put eur four hundred zero into the yes campaign have laid off three hundred people today
one thousand five hundred and fifty jobs have gone since saturday the only jobs that were preserved by the yes vote were the jobs of the political class
i suspect that it is all over
i suspect that for ireland their period of independence will be a very brief one in their history
i do not think that president klaus will be able to hold out i hope that he does he is a fine and brave man
but it looks like we have got the victory of bureaucracy over national democracy
in historical terms i think britain now finds herself very alone perhaps as she was back in nineteen forty but there is a real debate there is a real debate here
what is the point of having a conservative prime minister if mr blair becomes the overlord
what is the point of a foreign secretary if we have got an eu foreign secretary with his own diplomatic service
what is the point of any of it
as far as i am concerned this irish referendum begins the real debate
there is no more pretending if you want national democracy you cannot remain a member of this european union and we will campaign for britain to leave and to leave as soon possible
