mr president the topic of the report is doubly sensitive both politically and economically
on the one hand the eu wants to prevent dual-used goods to be used for military purposes and or against people
on the other hand it has to consider the economic interests of producers and users
the regulation is therefore inevitably bushy having to cover for both existing intentional loopholes and anticipate for others in the future
moreover while for some the regulation would appear too strong for others it would appear too weak requiring constant revision
as a member of the committee on foreign affairs i fully support the need for a more transparent and stricter regulation
i am therefore totally in favour of authorisation before export and not vice versa
particularly after lisbon parliament can only help and this is exactly what it is doing here and now
consequently its role should be strengthened not overlooked
