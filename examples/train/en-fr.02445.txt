mr president i would say to the commissioner that it is clear we are dealing with a system which is broken
what is clear is that the european courts and european legislation are in conflict
we are no longer dealing with a situation where a law is being implemented but rather it is being interpreted in a novel way
i believe that the european union is best equipped to deal with the challenges of immigration through a nuanced system which is not dictatorial not through more harmonised european legislation or the moral rulings of the european courts but instead through solidarity cooperation and good communication among european neighbours
we must be mindful that whatever burden is relieved in one place is not just moved to another
of course we have a duty to other eu member states and to people seeking a safer and a freer life but the recent court ruling points at larger problems which are the relationship between the european courts european legislators and the member states and their control of their own borders
commissioner i would be interested to know how the commission is attempting to confront these issues in the long term
could you please reassure this house that we will not just turn to the creation of more eu legislation which no doubt at some point in the future will itself be overturned by a european court but instead tell us how we can effectively support greece and other member states that are currently operating under such burdens
