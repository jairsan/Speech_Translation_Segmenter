mr president mr barroso has spoken of sustainable growth
in fact we have seen negative growth
he spoke of increasing the proportion of people in employment whereas that proportion has fallen
he speaks of increasing the competitiveness of european goods and services
however the eu like each of its member states is embracing globalism and voluntarily accepting a deluge of cheap goods that are emerging from low-wage countries in the third world
the only way in which we can compete with such countries is to drive down our wage rates to their levels
just in case our employers and employees are not getting the message we are filling up our countries with third-world workers who are turning large areas of our countries into parts of the third world with below-minimum wage rates and unsatisfactory working conditions
we are making workers in the commercial services sector redundant and outsourcing their jobs to the third world
the individual nation states of europe and the european union on behalf of the continent as a whole are committing identity and economic suicide
