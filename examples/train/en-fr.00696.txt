mr president as i underlined at the beginning of this important debate the european union has to play an increasing role in protecting the arctic environment in promoting sustainable exploitation of natural resources and in enhancing arctic multilateral governance
we are committed to the preservation of the arctic and at the same time our aim is to contribute to a cooperative system that will guarantee sustainability as well as free and equitable access
in order to succeed in these important endeavours we have to cooperate closely with all the arctic states and arctic stakeholders as i have said
in this regard the commission proposes to promote the full implementation and elaboration of existing obligations rather than proposing new legal instruments in order to enhance security and stability
strict environmental management and sustainable use of resources as well as open and equitable access
at the same time the eu has already highlighted that for areas beyond national jurisdiction the provisions on environmental protection under this convention remain rather general and we will continue to work within the united nations towards the further development of some of the frameworks adapting them to new conditions or arctic specificities
for example a new unclos implementation agreement on marine biodiversity beyond the areas of national jurisdiction could take the arctic into account and we have also submitted our application to the norwegian chair of the arctic council
the acceptance of the commission's application requires the unanimous decision of all the members of the arctic council
this decision which is due on twenty-nine april i
e
very soon might be negatively affected by an initiative that perhaps proposes an arctic treaty so we should be careful about that
finally let me say that the arctic coastal states have a clear preference for the unclos as a basis
the european union has to take this into account when we want to develop even stronger cooperation for the benefit of the arctic its inhabitants and its wildlife
in this context we should not weaken the existing frameworks for cooperation as this would not really serve our objectives and interests
nor would it correspond to the spirit of your own draft resolution
in conclusion i consider that the conditions are not yet right for an international treaty on the arctic and that we should rather focus our efforts on ensuring the effective application of the existing legal frameworks thus filling the gaps that might exist and adapting the rules to the specificities of the arctic
this seems much more feasible
