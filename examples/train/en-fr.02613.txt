mr president i speak as a former uk immigration minister
there is no doubt that the protection of the vulnerable and those seeking genuine refuge especially given recent events around the world is of great importance and priority for this house and i hope is even more important for the council
the uk like other member states has played its part in resettling refugees through national resettlement programmes in the past but it is hugely important that through a coordinated cooperative and communicative approach we discuss how we can best reconcile assisting those most in need with the situations of those member states that are already overburdened with national priorities
i am cautious however that programmes in this area should not undermine a nation's right to set its own policies
we also need cooperation and communication between parliament and the council more action by the council more determination by the council
i would like to seek a reassurance that it intends to inform this house regularly as to how it will proceed and if or how recent events in north africa will change the pace and process
i should also like to know whether increases in burdens will in the future result in proposals for compulsory quotas of refugees for resettlement in member states
please council let us get on with this
