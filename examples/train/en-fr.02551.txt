madam president this is simply not true and is not borne out by the statistics in my country
speak to any small businessman you like in my country
i am not interested in the honourable member's country or other people's countries i am interested in my country and my economy and i can tell you that all businessmen and women will say that they will not employ young women because of the draconian maternity laws
i wish i desperately wish you would come into the real world hands up any of you who have had a real job
