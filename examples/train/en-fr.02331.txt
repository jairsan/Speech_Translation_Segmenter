you know the position of the commission regarding nuclear energy
with full respect for subsidiarity in that matter some member states have it and some do not
no one is forced to have nuclear energy but in fact it is true that nuclear energy is in terms of climate change less polluting than other sources of energy
having said that the commission has certain obligations under the euratom treaty
at the beginning of the european union we had the euratom community and the commission has not only the right but also the duty to provide assistance to member states that require it in the fields of nuclear safety or research into nuclear matters
that is certainly what we intend to do
