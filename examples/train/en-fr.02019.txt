thank you mr president as ever for your great impartiality and support for this democratic process
i will be quick and also respect the timing
commissioner in my question i asked what consultations had already taken place between the commission and the uk government about their new plans
this is a very factual question
has any consultation taken place at all and if so what
i think it right to put that before you
will you accept today in this chamber that the structural fund regulation's requirements both for additionality and for partnership are fundamental and that you will ensure without hesitation that they will be respected in any new structure
