mr president back in two thousand and seven president sarkozy denied any link between the release of five bulgarian nurses from libya and the libyan order for french missiles worth eur two hundred and forty million
these arms were sold to a country held responsible for the lockerbie bombing and the supply of terrorist weapons
yet even gaddafi's son suggested that there was a link between the two deals
it was arms for prisoners
in two thousand and four the eu removed the arms embargo against libya in exchange for migration controls
that was arms for borders
now the london times reports that baroness ashton suddenly wants to drop the eu arms embargo against china which was imposed because of the massacre in tiananmen square saying it is a major impediment to developing stronger eu-china cooperation
actually i believe it is a major impediment to saving the euro is it not
just like the libyan deal it seems the eu is so desperate now to save the euro that it is prepared to risk our collective security as only the chinese have enough money to rescue the euro
this is arms for bonds
chinese foreign exchange reserves are usd two point nine trillion
it has already bought greek spanish and portuguese bonds
however china is also the country that bans the word democracy from its search engines and executes thousands every year
so i ask in all sincerity just how low will the eu go to save the euro
