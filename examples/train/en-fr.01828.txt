i thank you commissioner for your reply but i have an immense feeling of frustration because this is thirteen years that this has been under consideration eighty-four studies over thirteen years
there are certain parts of the population particularly unborn children who are extremely vulnerable to these chemicals and the changes have been shown to be irreversible so people's lives have been blighted from before birth as a result of this
given what you have said about the precautionary principle what is stopping the commission from at least putting forward names for the list under reach for going forward with banning these substances
