madam president my group can see many benefits in an ambitious comprehensive economic trade agreement with canada
however we have four red lines
firstly on the extraction of oil sands which damages local diversity we insist on the eu's right to use the fuel quality directive to inhibit their use
i was pleased to hear what the commissioner had to say on that matter
secondly we find it hard to imagine parliament approving a trade deal with canada while canada pursues a challenge through the wto on the eu's trade ban
here i cannot accept the commissioner's point of view that we should keep the two matters separate
i think they are linked in the eyes of the voters and they are linked in my eyes
i would certainly not vote for an agreement unless this dispute is settled before we reach the final stages of this deal
thirdly we would not be able to accept any limitation on canada's ability to use the trips flexibilities to export cheap generic medicines to developing countries
this is an important source of generics for developing countries and we should not bow to pressure from the pharmaceutical industry to make it more difficult for canada to provide generic medicines
fourthly we cannot accept a deal that does not address the different standards and preferences from local smes and state monopolies in canada
this was a point that mr papastamkos was making about the difference between provincial and federal regulations
they must be dealt with before this agreement comes to conclusion
that said if we find that the final text deals with these issues and is ambitious in reducing tariffs on eu spirits on eu machinery on eu automobiles and other areas we will be happy to back such a free trade agreement
but we do insist that the four items i have mentioned are red lines and have to be dealt with properly in these negotiations
