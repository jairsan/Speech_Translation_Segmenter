mr president while we are debating humanitarian issues and freedom of the press in third countries i take the opportunity to inform the house that according to media reports from gaza the offices of the un which were bombarded earlier on today by the israeli forces are completely ablaze and all the un humanitarian aid which was stored there much of it sent by the eu has been completely destroyed
the same fate has befallen the offices of reuters and of other international journalists in gaza
i wish to record that i share the view of the un secretary-general mr ban ki-moon currently in israel who is reportedly completely outraged at the israeli authorities
