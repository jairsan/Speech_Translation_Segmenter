mr president in presenting the mid-term review for the multiannual financial framework the european commission is bringing news which i believe will be a cause for concern for all europeans but more specifically for the british people
while there is a modest approach to limit common agricultural policy expenditure there is a more radical attempt to eliminate the british rebate
but worse still there is a clear intention to create a new own resource
like a thief the european union now wants to directly plunder the pockets of the british taxpayer
be it carbon tax a bank levy or whatever it is certain that the taxpayers will be taking more pain
when people see the eu taking their money they will increasingly resent the eu waste and lack of transparency
the elimination of the rebate and the creation of a new european tax let us call it by its correct name will not require a change in the treaty
however the agreement reached between the german chancellor and the french president about imposing political sanctions to ensure financial stability will require those changes
if the eu wants more power it must ask the consent of the governed
if eu politicians want a new treaty they must first give the people a referendum
now there is a chance for cast-iron dave to make good on his reneged promise to hold an eu referendum
i will believe that when i see it
