madam president i would like to thank all members who have participated in this debate at this rather late hour
i want to congratulate you on your level of interest and dedication to the subject
i must also say that i am impressed by the depth of knowledge and experience of the danube region that has been shown in this debate
i believe this is a very valuable asset for the union in the preparation of the danube strategy
i am sure that the commission and parliament will work closely together during this preparation phase
this is my response to my friend and ex-colleague danuta h√ºbner and many others of you who have raised this concern of cooperation between the commission and parliament
it is indeed our joint challenge to improve environmentally sustainable communication systems roads and bridges and to protect the environment and preserve water reserves in the danube region
it is to save and upgrade and its wider region
so in conclusion i would like to thank you for your support for the danube strategy
let us work together
the commission is ready and willing to listen carefully to your further proposals and to work together in the coming months to advance this very important strategy
