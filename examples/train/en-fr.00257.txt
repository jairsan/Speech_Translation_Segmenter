mr president like the previous speaker i would also like to pay tribute to the rapporteur for his report on this subject because it is clearly quite important
a number of us have received letters from our constituents asking about this particular scam
some very worried people including many small businesses right across the eu have written to me in my constituency of london telling me that they are very concerned that they have to pay this amount of money and that they do not want to face legal action
this is one of the things that the eu does well
i know i am critical about further political and economic integration but i am also pleased to point out when the european union works well
sometimes we should focus on what we do well and try to forget some of the stuff that we do not do so well such as the one-size-fits-all mentality
this is being called one of the first euro-scams but it is not really the first euro-scam
if you want to look for other euro-scams you can look at the european constitution and at the lisbon treaty
we are being told that the lisbon treaty is completely different to the european constitution but in effect it is exactly the same thing and to deny the people of britain the right to vote is truly a scam and a denial of democracy
