madam president i am pleased that mr schulz has asked me that
the difficulty is that when you form an artificial state that has within it more than one language group which is clearly the case in belgium you may for a period of time be able to hold it together but whether it is belgium whether it is yugoslavia or whether it is the european union if you have entirely different languages and cultures it will not hold together
the reason you are so upset about belgium and mr van rompuy got terribly upset about it and mr verhofstadt never likes it is that is this not the truth mr schulz
belgium is a microcosm for the whole european project
