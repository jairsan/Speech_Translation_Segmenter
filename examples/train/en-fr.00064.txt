mr president over the years it has become increasingly apparent that eu taxpayers are sick and tired of paying out eur two hundred million every year so that we can work four days a month in strasbourg
but the environmental impact in particular of these trips in a year equate to i am told thirteen zero transatlantic jumbo jet journeys and this at a time when parliament itself is trying to impose draconian environmental regulation on european business
surely it is a case of do as i say not as i do
the events of august and september have proved that there is no need to travel here and that the parliament building in brussels is more than capable of coping with our official sittings and that eu citizens would be far happier if we discontinued this monthly commute
i find it rather nonsensical that parliament has so long been incapable of addressing this issue and putting pressure on the council to put an end to this flying circus
