mr president we have rightly been having bouquets sent to the french presidency for its work here
it is jean-louis down there and i hope that in accepting that title he will share a little bit of it with our rapporteur on this dossier avril doyle
of all the dossiers in the climate package and i support them all that is the one that has been the most difficult to tackle
i think she has had the toughest job
in pozna≈Ñ last week it was the one that was in question but we achieved it the results have come by trust and by hard work
some in my group think that here and in other parts of the package we may be going too far too fast and at too great a cost
others including my own party think we could perhaps have gone further in many respects
we and our british confederation of british industry wanted a bolder policy on auctioning
we wanted earmarking of revenues to eco-innovation and new technology
we wanted to support low-income countries
we wanted revenues for forest protection and enhancement and we wanted clear performance standards for new power stations so that no coal-fired power stations could be opened without a co capture technology in place
but we have achieved funding for demonstration projects for ccs
we have achieved rigorous criteria for biofuels
we have protected small firms we have exempted hospitals and we have given industry that certainty that they asked for as they set out to meet the challenges that we have set them
copenhagen is twelve months away
we have made a start
copenhagen must take it on from there
