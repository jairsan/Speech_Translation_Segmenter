madam president i welcome the action of the committee on legal affairs in putting this timely question to the commission
the book digitalisation project impacts on several european and member state policy areas such as copyright competition library digitalisation and culture and as such requires both debate and measured consideration
the digitalisation of books has many clear benefits in both cultural and economic terms
it will make literature and learning more accessible to the digital generation
it will contribute to the dissemination of knowledge and culture
it will give students academics and universities increased access to information and research
for europe to be at the forefront of a successful knowledge-based economy we must move forward with new technologies and stay ahead in the knowledge race
my own member state ireland was known as the island of saints and scholars with a great tradition for producing literature and the encouragement and promotion of reading and literature is always welcome
unfortunately i have to say that most of the saints are gone
however the digitalisation project must not proceed at the expense of the creative process behind literature and the livelihood of the many stakeholders must not be negatively impacted upon
it is important to stress that digitalisation must only be accepted when the rights of the stakeholders including authors publishers illustrators graphic designers and literary translators are represented and protected
given the potential threat of digitalisation to the print book market it is essential to ensure that the rights of holders are fairly remunerated and this is an issue that i raised directly with the commission last october
in their response i note that the commission has already launched a public consultation and has held hearings to exchange views with stakeholders
i welcome these positive steps and if the european union copyright legislation is to be adapted there must be an increased engagement with stakeholders so that the change reflects their interests while at the same time facilitating a knowledge-based economy
