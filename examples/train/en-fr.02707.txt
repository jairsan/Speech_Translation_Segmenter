madam president i abstained on the vote on the situation in syria bahrain and yemen
the revolutionary movements that started in tunisia have inspired and encouraged millions of people across north africa and the middle east to engage in popular uprisings against the brutal regimes that have dictatorially ruled those countries for decades
those uprisings have once again proven the potential power of the working class and the poor to stand up and defeat their oppressors
i denounce the hypocrisy of the leaders of the eu and other western countries who today condemn the brutal repression that is used by these dictatorial leaders but who yesterday supported and provided a lifeline for their regimes
it is now vital that the masses unite across ethnic and religious lines to clean out the corrupt elites and build genuine democratic societies that can provide decent jobs decent education and end poverty
to achieve that the working class and poor must take control over the economy and wealth that exists in the region and use it in the interests of the majority
