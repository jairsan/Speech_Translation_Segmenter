madam president while the amended version was an improvement it was still with a heavy heart that i supported this own-initiative report since it was not consistent with the climate and energy package carried by a huge majority in this house on seventeen december two thousand and eight
just to remind us my own eu-ets report which was the cornerstone of this package was carried by six hundred and ten votes for sixty abstentions and twenty-nine against
needless to say mr reul was not among the six hundred and ten members out of six hundred and ninety-nine who supported my report
i have reservations about any reference to drilling in the arctic or exploration for alternative sources of oil such as tar sands
past months have shown that the importance of energy security has never been as acute
the cooperation that is necessary across the eu and the need to take advantage of the stimulus packages currently launched by almost all member states and the commission underscore the need for investment in renewables to increase our energy security to decrease our carbon emissions and to wean us off our high dependence on fossil fuel albeit over an agreed timeline
