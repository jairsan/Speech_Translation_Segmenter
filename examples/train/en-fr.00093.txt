in relation to the west african fisheries could i put it to the presidency that these fisheries agreements albeit bilateral need far more monitoring and revisiting by the eu and the commission to ensure that severe poverty and debt in these third countries do not put unsustainable and irresistible pressure to sign up to these lucrative agreements which often and generally result in seriously unsustainable and irresponsible exploitation of the resources
i think there is a big question mark about what europe is doing here
could the presidency please comment
