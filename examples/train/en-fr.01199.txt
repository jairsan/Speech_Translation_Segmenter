madam president during the two thousand and four european elections ireland introduced a ban on smoking in the workplace so we met many irate voters outside restaurants and public houses
they were furious about the ban
but this is two thousand and nine and there has been a huge acceptance that what we did was good for workers good for employers and good for the public health system
people have come to live with it
this morning i took the healthy option and walked into parliament and i was dismayed to see in cars young parents with children strapped into the back smoking cigarettes
there were parents pushing children in buggies with a cigarette hanging over the child
obviously we have a lot of work to do to educate adults about the dangers for children
so i support my colleague peter liese in his call for the protection of children
they are so vulnerable and it is so sad to see that they are exposed to this danger
but let us not demonise smokers
remember that tobacco is a terrible addiction and smokers need all our help and support to kick the habit
those who chose as others may say not to kick the habit should carry on with what they wish to do without doing harm to others and understand fully the harm that they are doing to themselves
this is a good resolution and obviously in ireland where we are well advanced in this legislation we are fully supportive
