madam president canada's prime minister pierre trudeau likened sharing a border with the usa to sharing a bed with an elephant
our union must share its bed with a bear
we must continue to try to develop relations in the context of the four common spaces and on the basis of last year's partnership for modernisation
as the commissioner said the last two years have seen improvements
the agreement on a gas advisory forum and the improved early warning mechanism are among these
progress this month in solving the transnistria conflict would be another positive step
however as baroness ashton said last month after the khodorkovsky lebedev judgment and as the european court on human rights has concluded on many occasions real progress requires respect for democracy and human rights and a stable and fair legal framework for business which are too often absent in russia
a structured civil society dialogue would help common action to fight climate change would help to build trust
but the russian bear still has a sore head and i advise the commission to carry to nizhny novgorod not only a jar of honey but also a large net
