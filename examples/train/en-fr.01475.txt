mr president late last year you and the high commissioner for human rights ms pillay came to this parliament and told us that the goldstone report into the human rights violations on both sides in the gaza conflict was thorough objective and met international standards
so let us not try to rubbish this report
let us act on it
with others in this debate i have personally spoken with representatives of the israeli government representatives of the palestinian authority and in gaza itself representatives of the commission set up by the de facto authority to plead with them to cooperate with goldstone and to undertake their own credible and independent investigations to bring to account those responsible for violations
i spoke with the us assistant secretary of state michael posner when he was here to encourage israel to do the same
to our spanish presidency colleague preparing for this friday's un vote i say do not pursue eu consensus at all costs
the idea put forward by some for a unanimous eu abstention would be a travesty for all the victims of this terrible conflict
we should negotiate the best text possible but then i hope more than the five eu states who voted yes last time will vote yes to keep the pressure up
this investigation into alleged breaches of international humanitarian law by the human rights council just as much as the two thousand and four international court of justice ruling on the separation rule should be treated with the proper status of legal rulings of international treaty bodies that they are
i condemn the leader of the conservative group in this debate who has called the un a suspicious source
it represents the highest aspirations for all of us on this planet and deserves all of our support
i would like to say in a european union forged from war for us war crimes must be held to account
so when the un secretary-general reported to the security council concerning compliance by israel and the palestinians that no determination can be made that cannot be good enough
these allegations must be determined and europe must show determination that they should
