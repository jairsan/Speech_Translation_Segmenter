thank you mr president
i commend the efforts of the czech presidency to handle the present gas crisis but just mediating one crisis after another is not the solution
the eu cannot remain in a babysitter role that of an
one conclusion is clear counting on a mutually beneficial strategic alliance with russia as a reliable provider of energy is a strategic miscalculation
the root cause of the current crisis is not ukraine but the crisis within gazprom itself which has failed to live up to its own commitments
for eight consecutive years gas production by gazprom has been stagnating at the same level
this is the typical result of political state control over production
not being able to deliver gas at the same time to russian customers and meet commitments abroad has probably brought mr putin to initiate the political crisis and point to ukraine as a scapegoat
this makes it all the more important for us to concentrate upon finding new energy sources
