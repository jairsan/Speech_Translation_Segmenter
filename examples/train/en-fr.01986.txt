commissioner you told us that the directive gives leeway to member states when implementing it in order to comply with social requirements but i am asking you as commissioner to make sure that those social requirements are fully respected
yesterday in this parliament we voted through the employment guidelines and we called for decent work
yet all over europe decent jobs are being lost in the postal service
they are being replaced by precarious low-paid jobs and we know that the liberalisation of postal services is driving this agenda
there is real concern among citizens and among postal workers about the loss of jobs and i do not think that we in this parliament and the commission can continue to ignore that fact
as a representative of a largely rural constituency i have received many queries about the obligation to ensure the collection and delivery of postal items five days per week
once again you have a responsibility in this area
finally i agree with many of the other speakers that we do need a moratorium on the full implementation of this directive
in the meantime
