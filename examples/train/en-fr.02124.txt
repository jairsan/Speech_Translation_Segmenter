mr president on behalf of my group's shadow rapporteur i would like to congratulate mr fjellner for the great work accomplished
the alde group welcomes this report which finally sets a clear framework for the provision of information to patients on medicinal products
patients need to be informed objectively and there needs to be a clear barrier between information and advertising
therefore information about prescription medicines should be regulated strictly
special attention has also been given to new media mainly internet websites defining clear safeguards developing mechanisms for the monitoring of contents and ensuring specific provision for proper enforcement
i would also like to make a personal point with regard to the materials provided to healthcare professionals for distribution to patients
there is no objective reason to exclude such materials from the provision covering other contents especially when we know that doctors are the most trusted sources of information to patients
i will therefore personally vote against amendment eighty-eight and i hope coherence will guide our voting position in order to maintain the major improvement that this report would bring to the commission proposal
