mr barroso i disagree with your response
in response to the criticism made by the european court of auditors in the last ten years the commission has turned to the auditors and this is recorded by the media and asked them to change their methodology of work so that the report on eu expenditure would show a better figure
in my thirty years of professional experience in the area of accounting and audit i have never seen the auditee instruct the auditor on how to do its own work
how can we now know if a reduction in the error rate is due to the change in methodology requested by the commission or to an improvement in the controls
