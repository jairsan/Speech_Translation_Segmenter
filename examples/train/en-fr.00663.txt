mr president first of all i would like to thank parliament for the very strong interest it has expressed and its continuous involvement with regard to ship dismantling
i would especially like to thank mr blokland
this is a very good starting point for further action at eu level to ensure that the european union plays its part in solving this international problem
these questions are also timely in the light of the recent ruling of the bangladeshi high court that you have just mentioned and the situation in that country
as a consequence of this ruling all ship recycling yards will be closed within two weeks as they have not been authorised by the ministry of the environment
the import of dangerous ships that are on a list will be banned and all imported ships will have to be pre-cleaned
finally bangladesh will start developing a national law on ship breaking in line with the basel convention
now let me turn to the situation closer to home by answering your questions
your first question concerns the phasing-out of the beaching method the method of dismantling end-of-life vessels directly on the beach
i share your concerns about the serious risks this presents to human health and the environment
we considered the question of introducing an eu ban on beaching in the impact assessment of our strategy
there were some concerns regarding the effectiveness of any such ban since it would be only applicable to eu-flagged ships and could be easily and legally circumvented by changing flag
we believe it will be more effective to put our efforts into ensuring that the technical guidelines currently being developed to support the future imo convention really do lead to safe and environmentally sound ship recycling
the progress in the development of these guidelines is so far very encouraging
it is very doubtful in any case that the traditional beaching method would be able to comply with the forthcoming guidelines
and regarding your second question i am pleased to confirm that the commission is fully committed to working towards an effective and early transposition of the ship recycling convention into eu legislation
the environment dg has already launched several studies and is working on assessing the impacts of the key elements of the convention
i believe that it is extremely important for the european union to show leadership and the high priority that we attach to this issue
this will encourage the ratification by third countries and consequently speed up the entry into force of this convention
but i share the concerns highlighted in your third question regarding the importance of not undermining the existing community acquis we need to safeguard the existing requirements in terms of workers rights and environmental protection when transposing the imo convention
and in our study we will therefore carefully compare the requirements of the imo convention with our community acquis
and i would like to stress that we will in particular ensure that the two thousand and six waste shipment regulation is not undermined
