mr president what we have before us here is the new government of europe a government that with the lisbon treaty now has enormous powers not just a foreign minister and embassies not just the ability to sign treaties but the ability now to use emergency powers to literally take countries over and yet what we have heard from the european parliament's big group leaders this morning is the demand that you take even more powers and do it even more quickly
perhaps it is worth reminding ourselves that this treaty that gives this commission these powers does not have democratic legitimacy in the european union at all
you ignored referendums you denied referendums and you bullied the poor irish into voting a second time
i am struck that the common denominator with this commission is the sheer number of them that were communists or were very close to communism
mr barroso himself was a maoist
siim kallas far from being a student activist was even a member of the supreme soviets we have top-notch communists there
baroness ashton ran cnd and still refuses to tell us whether she took money from the communist party of great britain
now i could go on but we would be here for some time
but we have at least ten communists in this commission and it must feel like a return to the good old days
there must be certain nostalgia amongst the communists
whilst sixty years ago an iron curtain fell across europe today we have the iron fist of the european commission
we have seen it with article one hundred and twenty-one and with greece effectively being turned into a protectorate
poor greece trapped inside the economic prison of the euro poor greece trapped inside the modern day for which it appears there is no way out what greece needs mr barroso is devaluation not sado-monetarism
goodness knows what that is going to do to them
in nineteen sixty-eight we had the brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty
today we have shared values
we have an ever-closer european union and pooled sovereignty and that is what you have used but of course it will not just be greece because the same is going to happen to spain to portugal and to ireland
article one hundred and twenty-one will be invoked with all of those
mr barroso you said earlier that we will stick to our course and that means millions of people in europe will be put through pain as you attempt to keep together this disastrous project that is the euro
it will fall to pieces of that there can be no doubt as surely as it did for britain during the exchange rate mechanism in nineteen ninety-two
you can laugh you can smile
it will not work
it cannot work
it will fall to pieces and as far as the peoples of europe are concerned the sooner it does the better
we need democratic solutions to this
if you go on pushing your extreme euro-nationalism this will lead to violence
we must vote against this commission
we must put the future of europe to people in every member state in free and fair referendums
