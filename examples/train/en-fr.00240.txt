madam president i would like to congratulate all those involved in this report and this very significant achievement the rapporteur gay mitchell all the political groups including my own and commissioner michel
food prices and the collapsing global economy will have devastating effects on people in developing countries
it has been estimated that for every one drop in the world gnp forty million more people will be driven into poverty
consequently it is extremely important that this proposal to cope with soaring food prices is implemented with urgency
the developing world is not the author of the current financial and economic crisis
if we are to avoid condemning another generation of people to abject poverty and hunger we must avoid short-sighted penny-pinching in the field of development aid
as has already been pointed out the figure of eur one billion may seem large but it is trifling compared to the amount of money we are pumping into banks and stimulus packages
i urge that this report be implemented as quickly as possible
