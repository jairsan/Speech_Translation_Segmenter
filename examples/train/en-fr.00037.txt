madam president i want to warn against a policy which tends to reward the belarusian leadership in compensation for decisions of the russian leadership which we do not like
it is simply wishful thinking to believe that in this way we can generate a rift between moscow and minsk or change the political orientation of president lukashenko
we should also not offer words for the liberation of prisoners who should not have been arrested
indeed the european union must avoid the isolation of belarus and engage in dialogue with the leadership of the country
to this end it must put in place a motivating package which should convince the regime and the ordinary citizens who innocently support it that the european union could contribute to improving the life of the belarusian people
on the other hand any opening should be gradual conditional mutual and focused on principally bringing profit to society and not to the leadership
mr lukashenko stated that opposition is good in any country but not an opposition supported one hundred from abroad
the problem is that the opposition in belarus could not survive because it is crushed by the regime
therefore we must not abandon the democratic opposition
