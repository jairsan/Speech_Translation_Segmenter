thank you mr president
let me first thank the rapporteur for the great work accomplished and all my colleagues for their determination not to give up fighting gender-based violence
this report shows that the european parliament considers that immediate action to combat violence against women is not only necessary but urgently needed
the commission must acknowledge that all arguments point to the fact that eu-wide measures and instruments have to be introduced
we know that throughout the union huge discrepancies exist in member states legislation to combat violence against women
last year a feasibility study by the directorate-general for justice found differences in access to protection orders the availability of support services and the expertise and capacity of the responsible public servants
we have seen signs of commitment towards the eradication of all forms of violence and an efficient policy framework at eu level notably within the women's charter which you presented last year and the communication on the implementation of the stockholm programme
nevertheless many member states have failed in implementing efficient legislation to protect women from all forms of violence and discrimination and we are now seeing that the core values of our union do not apply to half its citizens
therefore we now call on the commission to come up with a dedicated legislative proposal
a set of minimum requirements must be drawn up and incorporated into a legislative act which should be part of a comprehensive strategy addressing all forms of gender-based violence
this strategy and policy initiative should also be complemented by broad awareness-raising activities
i am thinking in particular about a european year on combating all forms of violence against women for which we are currently collecting citizens <unk>
finally having regained our founding principles laid down in the treaty and the commitment from your side which has already been stated we expect today a clear answer on how and when the commission intends to propose effective measures at eu level
