madam president i tried to undermine the compromise by voting against those parts of this report
i will explain why by reading out a letter to me from james mowbray who is a farmer near skegness in my region
he said i have personally been involved in the application of crop protection products for over forty years
i have always applied products with a sensitive approach to other human beings as well as wildlife
i have incurred no apparent detriment to my health or the wellbeing of the environment
i therefore find it distressing that the possible withdrawal of many products including the triazole fungicides is based on less than scientific arguments and will make my business not particularly viable and reduce the availability of home-produced food
i received these comments from him and from literally hundreds of other people from empire world trade based in spalding in lincolnshire john manby in parker farms in leicester john clark who is based in nottinghamshire jonathan reading and hundreds more names
that is why i voted to undermine the compromise
