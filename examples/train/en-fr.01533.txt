president barroso the question i would like to raise today concerns the financial situation in greece
article one hundred and twenty-one of the lisbon treaty is for the first time being used to push through structural reforms in that country
the good people of greece now find themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place as it becomes very clear that you are running the show in that country and not their elected government
does this mean as you have sent in your officials to sort out the greek financial situation that you can now be addressed not only as president of the commission but also as the governor of greece
if the measures your officials put in greece do not work do you have a plan b if so is it for greece to leave the eurozone
finally do you intend to send your officials into other countries suffering financial hardship for example portugal spain and italy
