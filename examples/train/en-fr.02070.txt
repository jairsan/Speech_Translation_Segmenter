madam president clearly the twenty million people hit by the recent disastrous flooding in pakistan need immediate and substantial assistance especially the one hundred zero children left homeless by the flood and in danger of dying simply because of a lack of food
critical to food production at affordable prices are the millions of small farmers and landless farmers now at the mercy of the landlord class
the distribution of free seeds fertilisers that are environmentally compatible and other utilities could lay the basis for a rapid recovery of food supplies but the liquidation of landlordism in pakistan and the distribution of land to the landless is a key to food sustainability
it was one hundred and forty years ago that the irish peasantry conducted a major struggle for an end to landlordism so it is long overdue here
tariff reductions must go to the workers and the poor and not to the landlords corrupt state officials or the profits of industrialists
small farmers in pakistan should benefit from just prices for their agricultural products on the world market rather than callous speculators on the commodity markets
