mr president if we are to alleviate poverty in the world we have to increase global trade
if we go down the path of protectionism because of the world's current financial crisis the only thing we will do is delay bringing millions of people out of poverty and millions of people will die
if we do not grasp this challenge right now and look forward beyond this crisis we will leave behind a legacy of such awful proportions that a billion people will find themselves unable to live
we have a food crisis we have climate change we have global warming we have floods earthquakes and all sorts of catastrophes which call for our help and the only way we can uplift everyone is to actually increase global trade and i am very grateful that the new trade commissioner-designate is listening to me
