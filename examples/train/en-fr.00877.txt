mr president in my final remarks i would like to stress that the council welcomes parliament's wish to make early progress in these important files and its recognition of the importance for the proper functioning of the common european asylum system
i can assure you that the council will now carefully consider the position which parliament has taken on the proposals in the work which is ongoing within the framework of the relevant council bodies
the council will in particular examine in detail parliament's amendments with a view to establishing whether an agreement is possible on those proposals on which work is most advanced
let me also comment on the principle of solidarity
a few honourable members rightly point out that some member states because of their geographical and demographic situation really experience particular pressure on their asylum systems
in that light the european council stressed the principle of solidarity in the european pact on immigration and asylum adopted in autumn two thousand and eight
the pact clearly calls for solidarity on a voluntary and coordinated basis towards better relocation of beneficiaries of international protection as well as approved legislation such as the part of the programme solidarity and management of migration flows and provides for financing of such activities in which the member states can participate again on a voluntary basis
it should be noted that the european asylum support office can be instrumental in these intra-community transfers by facilitating the exchange of information on such transfers
moreover the office can help by coordinating the deployment of officials from other member states to member states under particular pressure
however this regulation cannot serve as a legal basis creating an intra-community transfer mechanism
let me say at the end of my remarks that further work is ahead of us in the area as the commission has already announced its intention to table further legislative proposals for the purpose of completing the common european asylum system
these proposals will concern asylum procedures and the standards for qualification and status for the qualification of applicants as refugees as well as the establishment of resettlement schemes for people under the protection of the unhcr
we need to make progress as quickly as possible while ensuring that speed does not compromise quality
that is something on which i am confident we can all agree
