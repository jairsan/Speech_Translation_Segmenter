mr president i would like to thank the rapporteur for taking on my suggestion encouraging computer software manufacturers to take additional measures blocking access to pornographic and violent websites
this is a matter of particular concern to parents
it is a fact of life that our children are often more computer literate than we are
parents may be vaguely aware of the fact that they can activate filters in internet browsers but this demands a modicum of knowledge of browser software as well as a conscious decision to activate the system
if by default the filter was pre-installed in the on position it is probable that many more children including the youngest who increasingly use the internet unsupervised would be protected from unwittingly stumbling on sites which have a damaging influence on them
i appeal to manufacturers to respond to our suggestion
they should not see this as an imposition or a restriction but rather as a marketing opportunity
if i had the choice between buying two comparable computers and saw one displaying a child-friendly label confirming that filters had been pre-installed i as a parent would choose that product
in time parents making such a choice would ensure that this became the industry standard
i truly hope that we can achieve this with the cooperation of the industry
