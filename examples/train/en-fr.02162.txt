mr president i should like to say to the commissioner that the new energy strategy report ignores the elephant in the living room peak oil
but at least the commission has at last woken up to this gigantic and immediate threat
the moment one recognises peak oil the majority of this largely well-meaning report becomes sadly incinerator fuel
the huge energy gap opening up cannot possibly be filled by mickey mouse renewables or shale carbons
coal nuclear fusion and in the long term nuclear fusion plus fission are the only energy sources dense enough to save us as the oil age comes to an end
commissioner now that this has been recognised can we look forward to a new serious approach to energy
we must ditch all the nonsense about wind-power grids and global warming and concentrate on real scientific solutions to the peak oil crisis
