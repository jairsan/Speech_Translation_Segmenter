mr president let me start by saying how much i agree with what the spanish presidency has just given as answers to some of the questions of the parliamentarians
i will not repeat it because i would say exactly the same
permit me just to thank the parliamentarians who have intervened in a very positive way in order to underline the importance of fundamental rights which are the basis of our union
to reinforce those fundamental rights for each single citizen can only be an advancement of what we think as being the real values of our europe
i would like to thank specifically the two rapporteurs who have done very important work in order to bring parliament towards agreeing to the basic mandate but the basic mandate as has also been said in this house is only the beginning because we have to negotiate
these negotiations will certainly take a long time and when we have finished the negotiations the ratification process has to start
so mr president i foresee that i will have to come back very often with pleasure of course to this house in order to report on how we stand how we are advancing what the problems are and what the solutions are
i am very confident that the parliamentarians will help us in order to achieve the common goal which is a europe of values and of rights
