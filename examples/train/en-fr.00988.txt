this morning we had a debate on the preparations for g twenty
i know that there are different proposals discussed in the media but i must say that the eu is extremely well coordinated
we have had discussions with the finance ministers and tomorrow night there will be a dinner with heads of state and prime ministers to finalise the coordination in the light of the pittsburgh meeting
the eu stands united
we know what we want
we have a concrete proposal and the fine tuning will be done tomorrow
so i am not really worried about that and i am also very happy that with the help of the commission and commissioner almunia we have reached this very rare stage of strong unity within the european union
these are our priorities and our solutions that are being discussed and we will of course try to find cohesion on as many points as possible with the american administration and the other partners at the g twenty meeting
on non-proliferation we are very happy that this is again on the agenda
it has been difficult for some time to raise it and we are very happy with president obama's commitment to that
but it will take time
there are complicated technical issues and it will take time to pursue them
we are very process-oriented
we will try to move them forward but i cannot tell you how long this will take and what deadlines we have
but it is on the agenda
we are very committed to moving forward and i think this is also a wish that our american counterparts share
