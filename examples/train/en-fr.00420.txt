mr president today we debate and deplore the evil of the sexual exploitation of children
virtually every speaker in the debate rightly condemned paedophile activities and pornographic abuse of children
likewise the misuse of the internet drew the wrath of many
it is disappointing however that despite such unanimity several member states have not attained the same level of criminalisation of this abuse of children
grooming sexual abuse and child pornography should have no place anywhere in the eu nor should we tolerate any of it
silence is the best friend of paedophilia
we have seen it in churches families and communities where a blind eye has been turned leading to some of the scandals of which we are aware in our various member states
