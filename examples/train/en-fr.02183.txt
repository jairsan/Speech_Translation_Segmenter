madam president in iraq the death penalty was suspended after the us-led invasion in two thousand and three but reintroduced in august two thousand and four
since then hundreds of people have been sentenced to death and many have been executed
bringing perpetrators of human rights violations to justice is crucial for a stable future in any country and that includes iraq
politicians and former politicians should be no exception as they bear ultimate and often direct responsibility for such violations
it is well known that the human rights violations in iraq under the responsibility of saddam hussein tariq aziz and the like assumed grave proportions
fair trials and due process are indispensable in ensuring reconciliation and taking a constructive step towards a better future
the european union is a community of values and a unique place in the world especially when it comes to the death penalty which we have abolished altogether
in relations with other countries whether the united states china iran or iraq we appeal to them not to deny people the ultimate right the right to life as a form of punishment
jalal talabani has stated that he will not sign the order for tariq aziz's execution and we welcome that sign
it should be part of a society based on the rule of law in which the human rights of all citizens are respected and the eu is ready to help the iraqi government develop in that direction and ensure the just accountability of human rights perpetrators
the stability of iraq is fragile and may well be disturbed by state-endorsed executions
signing and ratifying the second optional protocol to the international covenant on civil and political rights as well as protocol thirteen to the convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms would help to solidify iraq's stance against human rights violations
it would also be a welcome step towards its inclusion in the international community
