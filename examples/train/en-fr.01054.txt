madam president for twenty ten we need a budget harnessing effectively all european policies to pull the european economy out of the crisis while at the same time preserving our long-term objectives and commitments which are sustainable growth economic and social cohesion and our obligations vis-Ã -vis the external world including candidate countries
in the draft budget the council has automatically cut thirty-six lines on administrative expenditure among other lines accompanying the instrument for pre-accession assistance ipa
the argument used which is low absorption is not justified as the necessary framework for the implementation of ipa could only be completed in july two thousand and nine
from twenty ten onwards the european commission must appraise and approve a significant number of large projects for which it will need to employ significant numbers of people to provide external short-term technical expertise
twenty ten will also be the year when the effective implementation of operations will start requiring the performance of ex ante controls by the commission on extensive numbers of tenders and contracts
the budget cuts mean that the sound financial management of pre-accession assistance is put in real danger with all its political dimensions
we should therefore remain open to reacting positively to the request from the european commission to restore the pdb level in this respect
