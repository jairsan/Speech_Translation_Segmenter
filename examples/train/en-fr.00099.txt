mr president this directive is very welcome because it puts legal flesh on previous proposals in the two thousand and six directive and in the commission's action plan on energy efficiency
public procurement has a vital role to play not only through leading by example but also because big contracts stimulate mass production and therefore bring down the cost of energy-efficient vehicles
technically too the time is ripe for this directive
the range and speed of electric vehicles has been transformed by innovation in battery technology
many vehicles procured by contracting authorities are fleet vehicles which return at night to a base where they can easily be plugged in and recharged so they are not dependent on the prior development of recharging facilities at service stations
to conclude i hope that this directive will serve as a stepping stone towards a comprehensive proposal on limiting co emissions from commercial vehicles
