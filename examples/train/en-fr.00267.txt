mr president the climate and energy package especially in the reduction of greenhouse gases is hailed as a triumphant step and i agree that this effort reflects a strong will to tackle the issue of climate change
however there is a move to criticise my country and new zealand for the high level of emissions from agriculture
both have a small human population and a large number of livestock which skew the emissions figures
do we not realise that irish and new zealand agriculture feeds the world far beyond its borders
talk of forcing these countries to reduce their herds is crazy in terms of food security and climate change
these are the countries that raise their herds most sustainably based on grass
instead we need to foster r d to find ways different feeding different growth schedules to reduce animal emissions where we can not destroy the animals
