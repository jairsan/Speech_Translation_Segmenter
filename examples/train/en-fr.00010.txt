with regard to the application of the community rules regarding aircraft operations the commission has no indication of weaknesses or safety-related loopholes in the respective air safety legislation which only recently became applicable in the community on sixteen july two thousand and eight
the set of technical requirements for aircraft operations is constantly undergoing changes reflecting the state of scientific knowledge
this is achieved through constant monitoring of the performance of operators hence at this stage a more stringent control framework is not deemed to be required by the commission
with regard to the application of community rules regarding occurrence reporting the commission is satisfied that all member states have set up a mandatory reporting system and collect the information in national databases
these rules contain a system of exchange of information and provide for the dissemination of information
the exchange of information is still not fully operational because it requires the agreement on individual protocols between each member state and the commission for the updating of the central repository in accordance with the commission regulation
the member states and the commission are actively working on this matter but information is already available at national level at this stage
the dissemination of information is correctly implemented on the basis of the commission regulation of twenty-four september two thousand and seven
the implementation of the protection of information has been transposed into national legislation but only time will enable us to judge the efficiency of these provisions which constitute the cornerstone of good reporting culture by ensuring the necessary trust of the reporters
with regard to the control of airlines with a dubious safety record the commission can reassure the honourable member that it is applying scrupulously the provisions of the community rules regarding the imposition of operating bans on air carriers not complying with safety requirements
today in europe fifty-four of all aircraft ramp inspections concern european operators
that means that the commission pays equal attention to the safety performance not only of european but also of non-european airlines
thanks to its constant and close cooperation the civil aviation authorities in member states are stepping up the supervision of their carriers
the results of the ramp inspections have been a particularly successful preventive instrument to avoid air carriers being faced with operating restrictions in the community
with regard to the standardisation inspection of national civil aviation authorities by easa the commission should like to reassure the honourable member that it is thanks to the close cooperation and mutual trust established between the civil authorities in the member states and easa that sustainable solutions are being agreed and worked out between the agency and the inspected authorities
evidence of the good cooperation is the fact that the agency has been able to double the number of inspections since the relevant rules were adopted in two thousand and six and the safeguard measures imposed on a member state at the end of that year were lifted this week
