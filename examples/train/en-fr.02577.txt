mr president at its beginning the uprising in libya had the same motivations and characteristics as events in tunisia and egypt
the gaddafi regime undertook an unprecedented lethal repression using air force helicopter gunships and ruthless mercenaries shooting to kill unarmed civilians
the massacre caused defections in the army the government and the diplomatic service
the people in benghazi and elsewhere took arms from the defecting army and the uprising is now an armed conflict unequal in terms of power
gaddafi has lost any legitimacy to lead having committed crimes against humanity against his own people
the protracted conflict is causing a great humanitarian disaster inside and along the libyan borders
it risks creating migratory flows towards the eu in particular the southern member states
it also raises the world price of oil to levels dangerous for the world economy
it is therefore imperative that the conflict ends immediately but gaddafi must not prevail
the no-fly zone must be implemented urgently and we should use all other possible means to assist the pro-democratic libyans to defeat the forces who through bribery intimidation and tribal manipulation are still supporting gaddafi
we can imagine what it will mean if gaddafi succeeds
we will be witnessing a situation worse than that of rwanda to the shame of all humanity
resolute action is needed now
