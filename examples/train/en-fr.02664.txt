mr president the grelier report gives too many concessions to the commission i would say
west of scotland fishermen find it difficult to understand why it is that the commission can say that it wants to eliminate discards and at the same time reject amendments to these technical measures
the commission prefers to extend the current range of technical measures that are causing discards including of haddock for at least another eighteen months
the commission prefers another eighteen months of so-called temporary measures which have failed to conserve the stocks
another eighteen months of dumping dead fish back into the sea
i urge colleagues tomorrow to support all of the amendments in our vote and i hope that these amendments will be adopted and if they are adopted i hope that the commission will change its attitude and grasp the opportunity that presents itself to act now on discards not just talk about action at some time in the future
