mr president the current situation in the region is both full of risk and full of hope
for me the emergence of democratic movements among israel's neighbours is a cause of celebration
we must reject the racist stereotype that regards them as a threat
i led a parliamentary delegation to gaza and the west bank in december twenty ten
the most heart-rending story was that of a little boy who brought his toys to school every day because he was not sure when he came home whether his home and his family would still be there
that child's parents want peace
every member of the plc that we met both in the west bank and in gaza wants secure israeli and palestinian borders based on the nineteen sixty-seven green line
they also want the settlements to stop
it is incomprehensible that prime minister netanyahu has refused appeals from all of israel's allies to stop the settlements
simply to stop them
not to dismantle them
to stop them
it is necessary in order for serious negotiations to get under way for those settlements to stop
i would appeal to ms ashton to ensure that that appeal goes again to the israeli authorities to please stop the settlements and get the talks going
we must support the efforts of president abbas and prime minister fayyad to peacefully lead the palestinian people to a palestinian state
we do not know what the consequences will be if we do not do that soon
