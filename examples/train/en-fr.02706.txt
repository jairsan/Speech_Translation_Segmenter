madam president i voted in favour of the amendment insisting on a nuclear-free future for europe
the tragedy of fukushima underlines the huge danger that nuclear power represents for humanity and for the environment
the potential for massive catastrophe and the lack of a safe way to dispose of spent nuclear fuel means that nuclear power does not represent a safe means to develop energy production
the tragedy also underlines the fact that private profiteers cannot be trusted with the vital task of energy production and energy distribution
ultimately the capitalist pursuit of profit without regard for human life human safety or the environment is responsible for this crisis
i call for the nationalisation of the energy sector under democratic worker control and management
on that basis we could develop a rational and sustainable plan for energy production distribution and use to provide cheap and safe energy for all while protecting the environment
at the centre of that plan there must be a long-term programme of investment in renewable energy sources leading to the progressive replacement of oil gas coal and nuclear power stations
