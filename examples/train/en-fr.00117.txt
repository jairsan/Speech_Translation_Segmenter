mr president the eplp welcomes the content of this joint resolution and motion regarding the financial climate and the broader economy
as to what we might do next it is true that parliament has set out a series of demands which have been a kind of a wish list to some degree and also concrete proposals about what needs to be done
at times we have gone further than the commission
indeed at times maybe for national reasons or for political interests we have seen parliament both water down text and propose good text
but those calls are quite relevant today and are germane to the condition that we are in
supervisory structures need more than ever to be strengthened but at the global level not just at a european level
we have to look outside the european union
for that we also need to consider what is happening in terms of development aid around the world
we need to deepen our reserves in terms of dealing with development issues not walk away from them and it is hoped that by doing this we will reach the kinds of economic equilibrium that is needed around the world
it is our role to draw attention to these issues
it is also our role to do something more about this and i will submit more on this issue in writing
