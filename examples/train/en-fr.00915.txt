mr president this is my first opportunity to congratulate all the honourable members on their election to the new european parliament
i can say on behalf of the commission that we very much look forward to a constructive cooperation with you including of course on some of the most pressing international challenges that we face and the subject of today's debate is certainly one of those
my colleague benita ferrero-waldner is travelling this week and so i have offered and have been delighted to be able to speak on her behalf in parliament today
finally i join with the presidency in expressing condolences to the families of iranians and armenians involved in the tragedy of the plane crash today
this parliament plays an important part in maintaining and developing relations between the european union and the islamic republic of iran
exchange visits between parliament's iran delegation and members of the majlis have already played an important role in increasing mutual understanding
parliament has also played its part in setting up several instruments that serve as an important basis for eu activities in iran and we in the commission hope to continue to make good use of these in the years ahead
today's debate was prompted by the recent iranian presidential elections and the subsequent events
while as the presidency has said the evolution of iran's politics and policies are chiefly a matter for the citizens of iran there can be no doubt of the broader significance and it is right that we should follow these developments closely
the european union has taken very clear positions on the situation in iran following the presidential elections and has remained united in these positions
we have expressed full respect for the sovereignty of iran but have stressed our deep concern about the post-election violence as we would when lives are lost or rights are put at risk in any country
allegations of european interference in the iranian elections or any involvement in the protests which followed are unfounded
however suppression of peaceful demonstrations arbitrary detentions and severe censorship of the media constitute violations of human rights which cannot be considered matters confined to the domestic affairs of any country
in spite of the current delicate situation in iran the commission believes strongly in maintaining a dialogue
that was the case before the elections and it remains the case now
the european union and iran have many common and pressing interests including the fight against drug trafficking and support to afghan refugees
these demand our continued attention and cooperation and we hope that iran will share this view
the commission continues to search for ways to deploy community instruments in constructive activities in iran
we can increase mutual understanding by continuing for instance our cooperation through erasmus mundus academic exchanges
we are convinced that the european union should keep all available channels of communication open with iran
we should strive for engagement with iran at all levels
when possible and prudent we stand ready to continue and expand cooperation in the future
our present differences with the government of iran are many some are very serious
we call on the government of iran to join us in trying to find solutions to our differences through dialogue
it is only through discussing the challenges that lie between us in a spirit of mutual respect that we can hope to overcome them
europe has never closed the door to such discussions and it remains open today
