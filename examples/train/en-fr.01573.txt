mr president i hope we are agreed that we need a proactive foreign policy guided by our european common goals and based on our common values
this policy should recognise the indivisibility of security in the globalised world as it is a source of solidarity of interest both within the european union and outside
such a policy requires and presupposes an adequate institutional instrument
thus the priorities are clear and i am happy to see that these priorities i am going to mention are the same as those of mrs ashton
an efficient external action service a vibrant neighbourhood policy a visionary enlargement policy well-structured partnerships with the strategic players both traditional and emerging an effective strategy in coping with the global challenges namely energy security non-proliferation migration transnational organised crime transnational expression of poverty cultural conflicts and so on
as far as the external action service is concerned we need an institution which should be built not only on the principle of political and budgetary accountability but also on the principle of effectiveness
we should not build a service which preserves the old national competition or the present bureaucratic structure
the two-headed head of the european external actions must wear both hats at all times thus assuring the unity of the service and the coherence of its action
on external neighbourhood policy we need an approach which does not exclude russia and turkey
on the black sea we have to move from synergy to strategy
on frozen conflicts we need regional initiatives and mechanisms of regional cooperation and security under international guarantees
on global security we need a new arrangement reflecting the post-bipolar-order realities
we have to promote our values in the world but in a secular way and not as new crusaders
i think that these and many others are our priorities which circumscribe a herculean task
let us work together parliament the commission and the council to accomplish this task
