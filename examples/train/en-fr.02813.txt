mr president we had long-drawn-out negotiations involving six political groups on this particular resolution
it is a compromise resolution and obviously it contains elements that many of us wish were not in it and indeed it excludes elements that many of us wish were in it
but the agreement among the six political groups was that there would be no amendments oral written or in any other form and therefore i think it is a breach of the understanding and makes a nonsense of the negotiations if we now have an amendment put forward in this way
we should therefore reject this amendment
