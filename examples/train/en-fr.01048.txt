as we know hundreds of thousands of people are losing their jobs in the current economic crisis and many of these are older people who are at a severe disadvantage when they try to get new jobs
even though the two thousand employment directive should be adhered to in each member state many of those older workers still do not know what their rights are under this directive and many member states are flouting the rules
even if some workers do know their rights all too often they find it impossible to take action individually without any back-up
at present we do not yet have legislation to protect many people against discrimination in access to goods and services but we do have the employment directive
can you tell us what action is being taken against member states who do not implement it properly and what mechanisms could be put in place to help older and disabled workers to achieve their rights
