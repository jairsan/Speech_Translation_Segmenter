madam president following the appalling massacre in camp ashraf on eight april the situation there remains critical
another bloody attack could take place at any moment
i have just returned from baghdad where i led a small delegation of meps in high-level talks with the president of iraq and senior government ministers
i have now brokered a solution to the ashraf crisis which you have seen baroness ashton
it requires the involvement of the un the us and the eu and needs your active encouragement to achieve the resettlement of the three four hundred refugees from ashraf to the us canada australia norway switzerland and the eu member states or wherever they have family or other connections
this is the only option that can avoid another humanitarian catastrophe and it has been agreed by the people of ashraf themselves
the european parliament relies on you to seize this opportunity to save innocent lives and avoid further violence and bloodshed
