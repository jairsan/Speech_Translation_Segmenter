as i said at the beginning of my speech one of the best tools for fighting child pornography and child sex abuse is the swift adoption of the commission proposal of march twenty ten the one against child sex abuse
the commission is looking forward to seeing the draft report of the european parliament and to starting trialogues
i count also on the member states and the european parliament to have a final text that will be essential to fight these crimes and i would like to draw your attention again to the principle of proportionality which i think connects with the latest question on this matter
