mr president i voted against paragraph seven of this report and i was disturbed to see yet again this parliament using a report of this nature to covertly introduce the right to abortion and also the linkage of sexual and reproductive health to that of public health in developing nations
it is not for this place to determine whether access to abortion is a right or not
it is a matter for national governments to legislate
i and the vast majority of my constituents in northern ireland remain firm in the belief of the right to life of the unborn child
