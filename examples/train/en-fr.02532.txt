madam president honourable members our discussion has proved productive in reconfirming the next steps necessary for montenegro to achieve further progress on its european union path
as acknowledged in the draft resolution we discussed today and in the commission opinion of last november montenegro has achieved a lot but needs to deliver substantially more
the country has now entered a decisive stage
tangible results are needed in order for montenegro to be able to move to the next stage of european integration
the momentum created by candidate status should not be lost reforms should be pursued with determination
the objectives are well known it is up to montenegro to meet the required priorities and once ready to engage in the negotiation process
the pace of montenegro's progress towards european union membership depends on its own achievements and that should explain my hesitation in prejudging an enlargement calendar as many of you have invited me to do
but i am positive that with our support but mainly with the determination of its people montenegro can make real progress towards the european union
