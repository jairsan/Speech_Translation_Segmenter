mr president own-initiative reports are usually just hot air but if adopted they are an expression of the political will of the european parliament
this report proposes the setting up of a union of seventeen non-eu countries with a parliamentary assembly and a secretariat with funding for projects of a truly ambitious nature
the funding of these schemes would run into many billions of euros which of course would have to be paid for by the citizens of europe
where this money would come from is not mentioned the reality is not allowed to intrude on fantasy
this report is truly bonkers but before we laugh it off we should remember that under the treaty of lisbon the european union has the legal right to sign the kind of treaties envisaged here
this report proposes the setting up of a union of non-european countries that could be later absorbed into the union that is what this report is really all about
