mr president i welcome this mid-term review of the european initiative on democracy and human rights eidhr commend the work of the rapporteur and welcome the changes allowing tax payments to be made
two-thirds of human rights organisations have been unable to obtain local exemptions so this loophole which has diminished the real needs of the projects will now be filled
to the commission i welcome the structured cooperation which has allowed parliament to be consulted on your annual programmes and i support the further amendments today on delegated acts
i also remind you of the need to integrate the findings of the electoral observation missions into follow-up in the country
and to the member states i remind you that when it comes to the next financial perspective do not be tempted to cut the eidhr
it has been tried before and failed and this parliament would ensure it would fail again
