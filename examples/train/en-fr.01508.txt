mr president i would like to thank the committee on the environment public health and food safety for its work on this dossier
i would especially like to thank the rapporteur ms de br√∫n for her efforts to reach an agreement on this issue which is a sensitive one for some member states
we also appreciate that apart from the issues involved she had to steer the process through the difficult part on delegated acts
thank you very much
i am pleased that the intense discussions held between the three institutions have resulted in a compromise text that fully reflects the technical measures proposed by the commission and also addresses the necessary adaptation of the proposals to the lisbon treaty in a way that is acceptable to the commission
indeed our joint work has been complicated and slowed down by this alignment
nevertheless the council is now in a position to ensure that this work is finalised on time
before a vote is taken on the compromise text i am pleased to confirm that the commission does not intend to propose a further prolongation of the transitional regime which will come to an end on thirty-one december twenty eleven
this means that fully harmonised rules will be in place from one january twenty twelve
however the commission does intend to propose a revision of the regulation in its entirety before thirty june twenty eleven and in particular the aspects of delegated and implementing acts
as regards the notification of delegated acts the commission will also take account of the periods of recess of the institutions in order to ensure that the european parliament and the council are able to exercise their prerogatives within the time limits laid down in the relevant legislative acts
finally i can confirm the commission's commitment jointly expressed with parliament and the council that the provisions of this regulation shall be without prejudice to any further position of the institutions as regards the implementation of article two hundred and ninety of the treaty on the functioning of the european union or individual legislative acts containing such provisions
i hope parliament will support the compromise text which i firmly believe properly addresses all concerns raised by this house
