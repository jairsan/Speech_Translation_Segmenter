mr president the wide range of instruments which currently govern international adoptions has led to confusion over whose role it is to safeguard the rights of children subject to international adoptions
the commission needs to focus further on the competent authorities and ensure that those regulating the adopters and the adopted children's rights are making sure that basic minimum standards are adhered to and that in the longer term the child is able to maintain a link to its birth country and its culture
specifically urgent measures must be taken to react to the abuse and trafficking of children which as a report in my own country today shows is alarmingly on the rise both within and across european borders
child trafficking and child laundering the stealing of children who are subsequently sold to adoptive parents as legitimate orphans is a phenomenon which does not receive adequate attention at an international level
i would call on the commission to play a more active role in the field of international adoption to take concrete steps to improve the convoluted and confused legislative framework which currently governs international adoption in the eu and to protect those most vulnerable young people
