mr president on behalf of my colleague lászló andor i would like to welcome the fact that the motion for a resolution for discussion today addresses so many crucial aspects of social policy's external dimension
the commission firmly supports closer cooperation at global level with employment and social objectives going hand in hand with economic objectives
in particular we support the continuation of discussion and the coordination of efforts within the g twenty
in this connection the preparations for a g twenty labour and employment ministers meeting provide a good example of the increased cohesion emerging at world level
the commission also supports close cooperation with and among international organisations which and i am quoting the oecd and the international labour organisation is vital for achieving a level playing field internationally and in particular for setting international labour standards
the one hundredth session of the ilo began last week it will focus on a new ilo convention on domestic workers an issue which this house discussed recently
social protection including the development of the social protection floor initiative is another area of interest for this year's ilo conference
we will closely follow the discussions on implementation of the labour standards enshrined in the ilo convention and i would point out that the commission welcomes the emphasis in today's motion for a resolution on the need for the eu to promote the ilo core labour standards and the decent work agenda worldwide including gender equality and non-discrimination policy as a cross-cutting issue
the commission will also continue to promote sustainable development decent work labour standards and corporate social responsibility in other policy areas such as trade and development policy
in twenty eleven the commission intends to present a communication on corporate social responsibility outlining proposals for further action at international level including promoting cooperate social responsibility in relations with partner countries
in our view the involvement of enterprises is also essential in order to address issues such as youth employment training workforce skills health and diversity responsible restructuring and local development especially given the current economic and social difficulties facing europe
