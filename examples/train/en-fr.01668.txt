i am sorry but i do not agree the problem is only with the big banks
in fact the problem created in the united states was not created by big banks only
it was also created by non-commercial banks by investment societies by hedge funds as well
so we do not agree with that analysis that it was created by big banks
in fact some of the big traditional commercial banks were not responsible for the crisis
there were many kinds of players that have some kind of responsibility for the mess let us state it very clearly that was created in the financial sector
we believe that an appropriate level of regulation is the best way to address the issue both for banks and for other kinds of instruments or operators in the market
