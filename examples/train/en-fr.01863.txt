mr president i voted against this report
while many here are no doubt ecstatic at the creation of the eeas as another milestone on the road to union the uk electorate gets angrier with the erosion of national sovereignty and is perplexed at the idea that uk foreign policy should or could become subservient to someone who is not elected by the british people
our foreign secretary now pledges to work closely with the high representative because the eeas is going to have a considerable bearing on the future success of europe's global role
the irony will not be lost on uk taxpayers that the same government asking departments to show the effects of forty cuts in departmental spending endorses a service estimated to cost eur nine hundred million that british taxpayers neither need nor want
those of us who opposed the creation of the eeas out of principle in two thousand and eight still oppose it
