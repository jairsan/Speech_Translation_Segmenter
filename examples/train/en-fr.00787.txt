mr president i would like to thank all those who have taken part in today's constructive debate
this is indeed a subject of great significance
for our part the commission will continue its work in support of the npt treaty through our work in verifying the proper use of fissile nuclear materials under the euratom treaty
it works to thwart attempts by terrorists to gain access to chemical radiological and nuclear materials through a strengthened community regime of export controls on dual use support for the efforts of the iaea to secure vulnerable nuclear materials and tackle nuclear smuggling which is very important and the promotion of a worldwide nuclear security and safety culture using the substantial resources available under the stability and nuclear safety instruments
i look forward to continued cooperation with parliament in taking these objectives further and i count on our cooperation in the future
