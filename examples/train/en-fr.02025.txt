mr president what is the commissioner thinking about
has the commission been asleep for the last two years
here we are at a time of economic stringency despite what mr van rompuy said this week
there are millions out of work some newer member states have still not got the promised financial package and germany has a billion-euro bill round its neck to underwrite the greek economy
in britain my government is raising taxes freezing public sector pay and pensions and cutting back on welfare while finding gbp forty-five million every day for this place
and now you want to spend eur one point one billion of hard pressed european taxpayers money on a programme to help partner countries along the eu borders
is that what you mean by more europe or is it an attempt to draw these countries into the eu
it sounds like empire-building to me
after all jos√© barroso himself called this an empire
we are told that the eu is to prevent further wars in europe but if you look at the record you will find that such wars were due to the empire-builders
now you are doing it all over again
do you never learn
