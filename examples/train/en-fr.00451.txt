madam president i welcome today's debate and resolution as the next step in the normalisation of relations between the european union and kosovo one year after independence
it is important to stress that those like mr van orden and mr tannock of the british conservatives who oppose the move have been proved wrong with now fifty-four countries including twenty-two of our own european member states offering legal recognition and our own eu rule of law mission has been deployed with the assent of serbia
indeed all along we have argued that a resolved kosovo helps serbia's eu aspirations and today we repeat that we want them to succeed
yesterday the eu justice mission opened its first war crimes trial in kosovo
today her royal highness princess anne of britain is visiting a school for disabled children in gjilan kosovo
surely both together demonstrate europe's commitment never to forget past injustices but to work today towards a better future for all
