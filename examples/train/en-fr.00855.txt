thank you very much
maybe the commissioner would comment on the situation of the german government on this matter
like mr martin i am a supporter of this free trade agreement with the republic of korea
however we do need to be careful about details and timing
it is estimated that six hundred and fifty zero korean cars would sell in europe per annum
while there is already some production in eastern europe there will be a significant volume of new imports
most surveys indicate that these will substitute the sales of japanese cars produced in europe like those produced by the honda plant in my constituency in swindon
this plant is currently mothballed and the workers are on standby
in order not to exacerbate the current situation here and elsewhere in europe will you ensure that there is a serious time lag before such imports are allowed
