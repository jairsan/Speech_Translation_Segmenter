madam president one of my constituents in london has informed me of serious allegations against a mr vladimir perisic also known as dr vladmir de rothschild who claims to be a medical doctor and a specialist surgeon
it is alleged that mr perisic is not medically qualified is not registered with the general medical council and that he uses his spurious medical credentials to defraud vulnerable people
he allegedly claims to have met david cameron and persuaded the department of health to consider his proposal for an nhs voucher scheme
as a result of this an article featuring him recently appeared in good faith in a national sunday newspaper
this could give him further spurious legitimacy to dupe those in need of serious medical care
he is potentially a dangerous risk to the public
mr perisic should be investigated by the relevant uk authorities and the appropriate action taken if the allegations are found to be true
the national press might also decide to play a useful role in investigating this matter
