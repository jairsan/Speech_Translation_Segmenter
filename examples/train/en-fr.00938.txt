mr president personally i think that the time has come to make a shift in our approach to energy problems namely by gradually shifting the emphasis from energy security that is trying to secure our current deliveries from volatile suppliers to secure energy meaning the full exploitation of the energy sources firmly under eu control
of course this will require parallel action in both directions for some time until the scales tip in the direction of the latter because indeed if europe really wants to become a truly credible international actor as such it should first achieve control over its energy supply
otherwise it will continue to be a collection of national actors each pursuing its own national interests and thus vulnerable to the divide-and-control tactics of ruthless external suppliers
