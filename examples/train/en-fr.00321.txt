madam president i concur with the comments made by my excellent colleague mr syed kamall on this matter
i abstained because it was my party's whip to abstain on this report but everybody knows that food security is a very important subject to us all which is why i am bemused by the way that this place deals with such a matter
in this particular report which i believe we all voted for we mention the problem we were just about to create for ourselves by voting for the plant protection products directive
we have just undermined european food security
about three minutes after we voted for this report we were basically ensuring that our farmers would not be able to grow enough food for our continent in the future
i find this bizarre
it is a shame that nobody else seems to read some of these reports that go through this place
