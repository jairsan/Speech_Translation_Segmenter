madam president i would like to draw this assembly's attention to the disastrous effect that the biocides directive is having across the uk
this punitive and non-sensical directive bans the use of strychnine which has been used to control the mole population in the uk for the past seventy years
this was the case until the eu got itself involved
as a result mole catchers are only allowed to use aluminium phosphate which costs twice as much as strychnine and is putting many of them out of business
but it gets worse
while strychnine kills a mole in up to fifteen minutes aluminium phosphate takes up to three days ensuring that the mole has a slow and painful death
this crazy directive is not only causing job losses across the uk but it is also cruel and inhumane and it is another small reason why the uk is better off out
