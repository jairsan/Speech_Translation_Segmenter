mr president it is very good and very important to talk about the integration of roma people and i wonder why the commission has only now noticed that some money has not been well spent
it is also important to talk about how the realities in the member states can be adjusted so that they fit the needs of the roma people but i think that is not the topic at issue today
today we are talking about the mass deportations carried out by france against the roma and even a lack of integration is not a justification for mass deportation
it is very clear that the roma in france are not being expelled on an individual basis and i wonder how you can fail to see that
it is very scary that the commission the guardian of the treaties does not dare to say this aloud does not dare to guard the treaties and the charter of fundamental rights
we cannot allow collective punishment
i ask you to take a strong stand and not turn a blind eye to the discrimination against roma in france and also in other member states because this is a disgrace for the european union
