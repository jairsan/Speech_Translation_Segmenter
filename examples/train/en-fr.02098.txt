mr president of the commission's fifty targets in the single market act communication i counted thirteen which concern my work in the parliament's econ committee but all fifty concern my constituency and the people i was elected to represent
fundamentally many of these eu projects if done well will be hugely positive for all of my constituents in wales
specifically smes are crucial to the welsh economy and to europe as a whole
therefore i welcome the proposals with regard both to accessing finance via the capital markets and to ensuring that the venture capital funds set up in any member state can operate and invest freely in the companies in the eu
mario monti was clear in his recent work that the single market had stalled
we need to reenergise the process and in that way remind our constituents that the eu does not just bring regulation and red tape at a huge cost but should and can actually bring tangible benefits for businesses and trade as well as consumers and individuals
this is where the real added value of the eu lies
