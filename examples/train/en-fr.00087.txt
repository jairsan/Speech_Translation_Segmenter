thank you for that comprehensive answer
the blue card could be a great achievement if it is comprehensive if it is fair and balanced
in that respect may i ask the council how to avoid the issue of brain drain or cherry-picking of the best workers not just from developing countries but from emerging economies as well
will there be some connection between eu governments the commission and the governments particularly the labour ministries of those countries to ensure that while we get the best workers and we compete for the best workers we do not then drain those emerging and developing economies of some of their best people that we monitor this issue and preserve freedom of choice but that we get the blue card right because it could be a very positive development for this place
