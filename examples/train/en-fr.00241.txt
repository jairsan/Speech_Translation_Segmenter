madam president i am very pleased indeed to be able to make a contribution to this debate very briefly because it is important in the times in which we live when the third world is suffering greatly from lack of food to realise that we in the european union although facing an economic crisis are nevertheless extremely wealthy compared with the third world
therefore i am very pleased by the fact that we in parliament are recognising that we have a moral and political duty to those who are in dire danger
we only have to see the pictures sometimes on our television sets to realise that the matter is extremely urgent
so i congratulate mr mitchell on this report
it is a welcome development that is worthy of our support and i am very pleased that i was able to give it mine
