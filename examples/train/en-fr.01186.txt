mr president the first duty of any assembly is to hold the executive to account
we are here as the people's tribunes
there should be a creative tension between us and the executive that is the commission
but when it comes to these budgetary questions the european parliament uniquely among the elected assemblies of the world sides with the executive against its own constituents in the cause of deeper integration
every year the european budget grows every year we have the report from the court of auditors that shows tens of billions of euros being lost or stolen
and yet we do not do the one thing which we are empowered to do which is to withhold supply in other words to say that we will not hand over any more money until the accounting procedures have been put in order
yet again we are waving through this budget despite all the errors in it and thereby betraying those who put us here who are our constituents and also our taxpayers because the majority of people in this house take a europe right or wrong attitude and would rather see things being badly done by brussels than competently done by the member states
