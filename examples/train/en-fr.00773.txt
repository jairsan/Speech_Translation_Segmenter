mr president apologies to colleagues for introducing it at this late stage but the reason is one of simple clarification
amendment one hundred refers to the responsibility of member states to exchange information about disciplinary and criminal findings against health professionals
this is absolutely appropriate but it has been brought to my attention at the last minute that this could be construed as saying that if such health professionals were involved in any traffic offences for example then member states would have a responsibility to share information about that
that clearly is not the intention of the amendment and so for clarification the wording proposed would now read member states shall immediately and proactively exchange information about disciplinary and criminal findings against health professionals where they impact upon their registration or their right to provide services
so this is purely a matter for clarification
