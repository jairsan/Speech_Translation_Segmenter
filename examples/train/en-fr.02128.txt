madam president tomorrow twenty-three november is the fourth anniversary of the death in london of my constituent alexander litvinenko
mr litvinenko was murdered by elements of the russian state in an act of state-sponsored terrorism
the three main suspects wanted by the metropolitan police andrei lugovoi dmitry kovtun and vyacheslav sokolenko are still free in russia
meanwhile mr litvinenko's dignified widow marina is denied justice
so far no coroner's court has been convened to investigate the death as would be the usual practice in the event of such a violent death
i therefore take this opportunity to call on the british authorities to convene a coroner's court as soon as possible to establish and publicly state the circumstances and cause of death and formally identify those wanted in connection with the police investigations for murder
mr litvinenko was a british citizen murdered on british soil
this is the least that he and his family can expect or should be entitled to
