mr president i am speaking tonight because my colleague mr bufton who would have addressed you is unwell
on his behalf i present this to you
as we know along with the cap regional funds represent the biggest part of the eu budget
for decades the british people have been forced to foot the bill for various projects around the eu most of which are of no benefit at all to the uk taxpayer
recently the bureau of investigative journalism in the uk unveiled the fact that eu regional funds are being used to prop up arms dealing companies in eastern europe with some projects receiving funding amounting to millions of euro although these are some of the richest companies
do they really need eu subsidies
given the fraud and waste endemic in this budget line and the way it is not even being used for the purposes its supporters allege i call on the coalition in the uk to withdraw funding as we need this money at home yet another reason to leave the eu
