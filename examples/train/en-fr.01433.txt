madam president let me once again thank you for the opportunity of addressing you today
i believe that this has been a useful exchange of views taking some concrete suggestions and remarks to reflect on
as i said at the beginning ukraine matters
it remains a partner of strategic importance for the european union and a leader in the region
eu-ukraine relations have deepened considerably in the past years
i firmly believe that this dynamic should continue in the future
the pace and depth of the rapprochement of ukraine to the european union will depend on the implementation of reform
that will encourage me to be even braver
the eu stands ready to support ukraine in this task with a wide range of tools at its disposal
nevertheless we look to the new leadership to demonstrate the political will for reform in the interests of ukraine's future stability and prosperity
