mr barroso you may or may not wish to comment on the recently leaked budget review paper but you will no doubt be aware that it has caused great concern in many regions across europe
indeed the first minister for wales rhodri morgan has recently written to you expressing his concerns
in view of this can i ask you if you will be bringing forward new proposals that ensure regions across europe will have access to structural funds post twenty thirteen
and if you do intend to bring forward such proposals will it be under this existing commission or under the new commission when it is appointed
