mr president my concern about the nuclear industry has been overshadowed by my concern about climate change and i now believe that nuclear has a role to play in helping us fight global warming
that was true before the incidents in japan and it remains true now
there are obviously lessons to be learned
there are the problems of design inadequate regulation not enough independence and obviously do not build nuclear reactors in earthquake zones
but we live in a world of hazards our cities have chemical factories across the board all of them present huge potential risks but we manage those risks we live with them
over the decades we have had horrific train accidents we do not close the railways as a result
we learn lessons we apply them and we improve safety
that is what we must do with the nuclear industry
