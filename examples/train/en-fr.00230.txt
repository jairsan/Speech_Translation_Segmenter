mr president europe cannot upgrade its relations with israel until its government convincingly demonstrates a change of course
it must end the collective punishment of the palestinian population by lifting the siege of gaza and demonstrate its commitment to engage seriously with the palestinian leadership to find a workable and sustainable two-state solution
we all want normal relations with israel but it is impossible in the current circumstances
i support without reservation israel's right to defend itself but such defence has to be within accepted international law and the responsibilities an occupying power takes upon itself when it invades another country
the state of israel which prides itself on its democratic system has been found in breach of international law on so many occasions in the way it treats palestinians that most people's patience has been stretched to breaking point
on a recent official visit to gaza jerusalem and the west bank i saw for myself the serious deterioration in the conditions of daily life for ordinary palestinians
their economy has been crushed
there are two hundred and ten illegal settlements
palestinian land and homes are constantly being seized
there are eleven zero palestinian prisoners and forty elected members of the palestinian legislative council in detention
over three hundred young people under eighteen years of age some as young as twelve years old are in detention
gaza is under siege and threat of military invasion and already fifty of its population is dependent on food aid
the list goes on
this brutal collective punishment and land grabbing by israel is a gross breach of international law and is destroying the possibility of peace
consequently now is not the time for this parliament to assent to an upgrading of relations
in fact i believe it should be deferred until after the israeli and palestinian elections due early in two thousand and nine
in the meantime every effort must be made by the international community to de-escalate the situation and to create the conditions for palestinians and israelis to live in peace
