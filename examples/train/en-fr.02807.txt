mr president it is true that the situation in azerbaijan is difficult and we have reasons for concern
here i would specially mention the case of mr hajiyev
i think the authorities should understand that peaceful demonstrations are a natural part of political life in any democratic country and that the pluralism of opinions and political beliefs is a fundamental part of a democratic society
on the other hand i must say that it is rather unfortunate that we have put the urgent issues of azerbaijan and belarus one after the other one week after azerbaijan became and was welcomed as a founder of the euronest parliamentary assembly together with us the european parliament
we need engagement both with the authorities and with civil society and we have to do more in addition to adopting urgent measures and resolutions
the eastern partnership and the euronest assembly are a good platform for such an engagement and i feel that there is a new wind coming from azerbaijan a renewed wish for political dialogue
the pcc which is going in june to azerbaijan should use this opportunity to raise the human rights issue but also to establish a more consistent dialogue with the country
