madam president i will focus on the report since it is an extremely useful and important report
i would like to thank mr ehrenhauser for his contribution
the report is useful because it rightly focuses on the key element of civil-military cooperation which is exactly the commission's priority
it deals with the main points related to the eu's comprehensive approach in crisis management
the establishment of the european external action service is the exact expression of this priority
the very concept of the service that the high representative is putting in place points in the same direction as the one suggested in the report in particular through the inclusion of the structures of the common security and defence policy in the external action service
we fully support the development of civilian capabilities in order to have a proper balance between resources
the appropriate modalities for recruitment are now agreed and appropriate expertise can be brought into the external action service
as everyone knows this was not possible before
a number of points in the report have been taken into account and specific actions have been launched
this relates in particular to fostering civil-military synergies better usability of the eu battle groups training financing and cooperation with key partners in particular nato and the united nations
we also support the reinforcement of relations between the eu and the united nations
we have already done a lot together
the high representative again met with the un secretary general in lisbon last saturday
the relationship between the eu and nato is an important issue as was illustrated just yesterday at the nato summit in lisbon
we also favour implementing all practical measures which can reinforce concrete cooperation between the eu and nato and ensure in particular cooperation when both are deployed in the same theatre
the commission and the high representative herself are looking forward to working together with the european parliament on this important issue of civil-military cooperation
