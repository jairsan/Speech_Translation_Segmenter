mr president this evening i attended a reception for the shen yun performing arts group in the members salon
last year i had the pleasure of seeing the shen yun show in london
its purpose is to revive interest in and to illustrate traditional chinese culture a culture of course that the chinese communist party and government have done their best to destroy over the last sixty years
i was appalled to learn this evening that a planned performance in romania in april had been cancelled because of pressure from the chinese government
it is completely unacceptable that romania a country that claims to be a democracy allows itself to be pressurised in this way by a communist tyranny
i should also say that shen yun promotes the philosophy of truthfulness tolerance and compassion so it is not surprising that the chinese government and communist party fear that contrary ideology
i would like to suggest to the president mr buzek that we redress the situation by inviting shen yun to stage a sample performance in the parliament at the earliest convenient date
this would be a clear gesture of support to those incomparably brave chinese democracy activists
