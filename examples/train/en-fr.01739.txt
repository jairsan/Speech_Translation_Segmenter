madam president i would like to refer to the mechanism to assess corruption in the member states the mechanism that is provided for in the action plan
we have a council decision for the stockholm programme which refers to this matter and we have the commission action plan on implementing the stockholm programme
they both refer to an evaluation of the anti-corruption efforts in the member states
therefore we need strong political will and commitment from the member states for such a mechanism to come into place
i say this because we all know that so far the domestic efforts have not been effective in all member states to say the least
secondly the deadline for the communication in the action plan on the union's policy and mechanism against corruption is twenty eleven
i would like to suggest having it done before the end of twenty ten
this would better respond to the need of combating corruption in the union as corruption is also seen as a cause of the economic crisis
therefore it would be a measure to stop and prevent it
