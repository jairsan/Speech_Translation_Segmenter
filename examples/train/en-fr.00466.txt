madam president there is no dispute about the fact that the oil apparently came from northern ireland
that is not the issue
the pertinent point is that millstream chose to buy in that oil knowing it was looking for oil to use in dryers to deal with feedstuff to dry the breadcrumbs so why was it buying oil of that sort no matter where it came from
why was it not checked by state inspectors and by the company itself
the use of oil in that circumstance is as i understand it illegal a breach of the food and hygiene regulations
so where it came from is not the issue it is why it came there and why it was used for the purpose for which it was used
