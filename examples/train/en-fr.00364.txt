mr president i abhor terrorism
i repudiate the propaganda of terrorism
maybe coming from northern ireland heightens my awareness so when i hear hamas bleat because of necessary retaliatory action against its years of indiscriminate raining of rockets upon innocent citizens in israel then i am unimpressed because i know that hamas like the ira in my country are masters of the twin arts of terrorism and propaganda
the situation is demonstrably clear
israel accepts a two-state solution
hamas cannot even abide the right of israel to exist and thus unleashes endless relentless terrorist attacks upon its territory
and when after much forbearance israel hits back they cry victim
sorry they are the perpetrators and if they want peace the answer lies in their own hands
stop shelling israel
