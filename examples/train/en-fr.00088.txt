can i assure the minister that we all want to look after the citizens health and the environment but does the council agree with the call for a european commission impact assessment on the effects of food production and food supply because of this legislation in each member state
the fact that the european commission has failed to do this to date is totally unacceptable
would the council agree that without proper up-to-date information we cannot be expected to make informed choices and decisions
