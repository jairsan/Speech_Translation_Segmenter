madam president i would like to congratulate the rapporteur also
it has been said that the ageing population has a significant impact on social protection and public finance
within the overall context of demographic change women are traditionally at greater risk of poverty and limited pensions
therefore it is vital that we policy makers should be kept aware of the issue and the concerns of older people especially women in order to ensure that they are not marginalised
in this regard it is necessary to continue fostering our efforts both at eu and national level towards the full use of existing instruments and future measures in the areas of pensions policy health and long-term care policy employment policy migration and integration policy and infrastructure development
this is an issue that we have to discuss more often in this house
