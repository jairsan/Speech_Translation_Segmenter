madam president first of all may i congratulate the rapporteur mr h√∂kmark on skilfully piloting this report through the committee and achieving a very broad measure of consensus
i join with the other shadow rapporteurs in thanking him for his work
i very much support his desire to legislate so as to see europe meet the technological challenges in this sector and maintain a leading position in the world
this is cutting-edge technology and it is very important
the key point is getting the right balance between the different interests involved the incumbent broadcasters the mobile operators broadband provision and the official users including the military and civil emergency services
i just want to sound the slight warning note that we must respect subsidiarity and national competences in this area and in this process
legislating in this field of policy is particularly difficult because the technologies involved change and advance so rapidly and so much which means that we are always playing catch-up rather than legislating ahead of the game
nevertheless i think we must act to clear the way for the new technology for its exploitation and utilisation of spectrum and i hope that this proposal and this report will do just that
