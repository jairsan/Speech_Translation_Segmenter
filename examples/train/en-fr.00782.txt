madam president moldova's state brings back miserable memories of europe's unhappy past a communist government declaring victory on its own terms protesters beaten and killed accusations that neighbours are orchestrating unrest
if there is real evidence that the romanian security service has stoked violence then that should be subject to scrutiny by the international community
this parliament's mission next week must seek evidence regarding reports of two hundred zero additional ballots printed allegations that four hundred zero voters registered on election day with inadequate id and claims that voters in transnistria were disenfranchised en masse
until those are investigated until the osce reports many will simply not believe the results whatever moldova's courts conclude
it may be that commissioner ferrero-waldner's instinctive optimism proves misplaced
president voronin should also denounce the detention beatings and extrajudicial killing of young people randomly rounded up after the protests
no more obstacles to lawyers or ngos no more withholding the names and numbers of those detained
i would like the commission to confirm whether moldova's expulsion of romania's ambassador and demand for visas from travellers breaks the agreements our union has with that country
if so what action will the commission take
president <unk> announcement on passports also added to tensions
we must show sensitivity to bilateral relations but nonetheless insist agreements are honoured
our moldovan visitors today describe a country where in so many ways freedom and democracy are denied where the internet mysteriously malfunctions where television channels vanish from the airwaves where state tv broadcasts belly dancing rather than reporting violence on the streets
our union while mindful of the geopolitics must understand the politics of moldova a people keen to exercise democracy and freedom of choice a country trading overwhelmingly with the countries to its west a land linked to member states of the union through geography history and culture
next month as our leaders gather for the eastern partnership summit they should make sure they build partnership on the basis of democracy and human rights
president voronin and his comrades must commit to that cause
our union must demand it
