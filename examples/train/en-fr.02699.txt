mr president as a liberal i welcome the launch of the single market act
removing national barriers should create an effective single market but is this really applicable in all sectors
it seems obvious to me in the energy sector and even more in terms of scarcity of resources and international tensions
i strongly believe that europe has to throw its weight to push member states to interconnect and invest in their infrastructure as a precondition for a common energy market and security of supply
however this new brussels mantra is only desirable so long as it reinforces competitiveness and lower prices for consumers and there are sectors where it might not be possible
i doubt whether creating european telecom champions establishing pan-european licensing in the audiovisual sector or a single market for on-line content will bring more competitiveness in the long run or stimulate creativity culture and growth
so maybe we should take time to sit down and think and should not charge like bulls into an easy-market concept
