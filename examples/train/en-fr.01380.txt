mr president i requested to make this one-minute speech to highlight the terrible effect that fortnightly bin collections are having upon communities in my constituency in the north-west of england
take my home town of bootle for example where many families live in terraced houses with no front gardens and little space at the rear
it is crazy that they are forced to put out waste every two weeks
this naturally has caused pile-ups of rubbish because there is no storage space
if we have a hot summer you can be sure that this will lead to an increase in vermin which in turn is a public health hazard
but why am i telling this house
well because fortnightly bin collections are the direct result of the eu's landfill directive which was supported in this chamber by the british labour party and the conservatives
i for one hope that a large number of british voters bear this in mind when they go to the polls in the general election later this year
