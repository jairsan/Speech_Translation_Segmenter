mr president seven hundred and fifty zero people in the uk suffer from dementia over fifty of these will have alzheimer's
the effects are common but everyone's experience is different
there is no cure for this condition which often holds hostage both patient and carer regardless of age
but what can be done in the eu
legislation is clearly secondary in what primarily needs local support
however firstly by bringing this topic to this chamber we can bring it to the forefront open discussion and increase public awareness
leading from this member states can decide on its prioritisation and sharing of best practice
secondly awareness can lead to a greater understanding of the symptoms and consequently early diagnosis
there are drugs on the market that can assist here and if taken at the correct time can slow down the process
the important point is this sufferers are helped families have information and support and ultimately the patients are helped to retain their dignity through this difficult illness
