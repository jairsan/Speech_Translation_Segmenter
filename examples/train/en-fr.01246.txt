mr president we were in favour of this proposal
i think it is very important that we help entrepreneurs right across the eu and in member states to create wealth and jobs and take people out of poverty
i am also grateful that we were looking at taking the money from the existing budget rather than new spending and using that to leverage even more spending from the private sector
however i must point out that we have to be very careful here when using state financing and taxpayers money
in my own constituency i am aware of some microfinance facilities such as the excellent croydon caribbean credit union which helps underprivileged communities come out of poverty
these facilities have been squeezed out by local government and other state microfinanced facilities
it is important in pursuing increased accessibility to microfinance that we do not squeeze out the many excellent private providers that are already there
