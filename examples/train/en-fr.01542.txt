madam president first to the two gentlemen who raised the question of the ipcc
first i am not here to represent the ipcc
i am sure they are perfectly capable of talking on their own
when i hear this is it not time to pause
i must just say that the international climate negotiations in many ways have been put on hold for quite a long time
we still need i believe substantial progress there
i simply do not understand why because of a few leaked things one wants to aim the scepticism at a whole project
that is not my approach
i am the politician
i cannot judge the work of the scientists but i can use my common sense and i can read their main conclusions and see what the facts on the table are like
then i can myself weigh up whether i want to run the risk of doing nothing with the very big implications that might have or instead will i try to respond to the challenge
what i simply fail to understand is that those who are sceptical of this climate issue cannot see that it will always be good for a planet whose population is approaching nine billion people or even more by the middle of this century to become much more energy efficient and much more resource efficient
so that is where we should have common ground when it comes to the tools because that will anyhow benefit our environment benefit our citizens and benefit our economies
it will also benefit business to become very energy efficient in a future where energy is becoming still more expensive
that will pay off on the bottom line in a world where there will be a struggle over resources
so i simply do not understand why we cannot take on the same kind of agenda from that angle
to mr florenz what do we do with the instruments on the ets
well as mentioned there will be an analysis of the carbon leakage coming out before summer and when it comes to the benchmark we will continue the work with the benchmark
there are still many things to be worked on with the ets
i also think that we should still work with those other parties around the world who are planning to get some kind of trading schemes
i still think that that will be the most efficient way of trying to regulate this but then of course it is very important that we have our own systems up and running working as efficiently and as business-friendly as possible so that they can see that it actually works and that in the end it also benefits their possibility of providing innovation
