mr president first i would like to welcome the stockholm programme as the best way forward to a citizen-centred europe and to thank both minister ask and minister billstr√∂m for their vision
finally we can go home and tell everybody without distinction that europe is for them europe is with them europe is us
of course the stockholm programme will be what we make it
let us give it a chance
let us support it as broadly as possible and get down to work to implement it
i would like to say a special thank you for the focus on children which means that we can finally work on enhanced action to protect children including migrant children
it is also very good that we have a greater possibility to combat cross-border criminality while respecting individual rights
