madam president before we criticise russia for human rights abuses we should look at similar abuses even within the european union countries in which opposition parties are physically attacked such as hungary or attacked by the militia of the ruling party such as even the united kingdom or countries that lock people up for non-violent dissent or ban political parties like belgium
we must conduct relations with russia on the basis of the interests of our own member states and not on hypocritical outbursts
