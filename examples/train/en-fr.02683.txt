mr president today we have voted on the three single market act reports and their key priorities i hope the commission and council have taken note of these
we need to make sure that we deliver on this for all citizens in order to allow the european economy to grow provide jobs and compete globally
we need to make sure that eu legislation is implemented across the board to reduce the barriers to trade but also that we do not make eu legislation that increases the burden on our businesses
