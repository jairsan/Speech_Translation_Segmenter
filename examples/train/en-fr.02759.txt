mr president there is a problem in the european union because our citizens are dumping on their own doorsteps
to do that in europe is one thing but to do it to the developing world and to the poor is as the authors of this question said reprehensible
i will listen carefully to the commission's response about new legislation
i am always concerned that we layer legislation on top of existing laws without looking at the enforcement aspects and i would ask the commission to address the issue of enforcement
i think in many areas we do not have sufficient numbers in member states to correctly keep control and account of the transportation issue in this case of toxic waste
the consequences for the health and welfare of those who handle this waste in a very inappropriate way are extremely serious
this is a moral and ethical question
perhaps if our citizens were aware of this i think they are not they might think twice about their purchasing and disposal methods
