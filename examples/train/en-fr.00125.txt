could i ask the commissioner if he might in these times when recession is snapping at our heels look at the possibility of the social fund cooperating with local development partnership boards where these exist in member states like the republic of ireland but in other member states as well
in that regard he might have discussions with the oecd which has carried out a study of the effectiveness of local development in promoting training education micro-job creation and an improved environment for people who find themselves unemployed
i do not expect the commissioner to be able to answer all of that today but what i am really asking is that he would look at this possibility and perhaps consult with the oecd to see how the social fund and social partnership and local development partnerships might work hand in hand to improve the community training and employment needs of our citizens particularly in urban areas
