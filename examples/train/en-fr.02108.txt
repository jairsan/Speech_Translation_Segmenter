madam president i note with gratitude that today is a public holiday in belgium to commemorate the millions that died in two world wars
i am somewhat dismayed that this chamber is not following suit and commemorating those millions so i respectfully call for a moment of silence to commemorate all those who died in war in the name of democracy
