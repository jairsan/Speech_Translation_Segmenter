mr president i voted against the own-initiative report on the union for the mediterranean for a number of reasons
there is no doubt that a stable mediterranean is a huge prize for the wider europe
however at a time when the economic climate across europe is perilous it is entirely inappropriate that this house should contemplate the expense associated with such a plan
grand meetings of heads of state a forty strong secretariat and neighbourhood packages do not represent a frugal economic policy at this particular time
furthermore i opposed amendment five for asking that the upgrading of eu-israel relations under the preferential economic association agreement should not proceed
in the delicate balance that is required from europe such calls will do nothing to give confidence to israel that this house will act as an honest broker
