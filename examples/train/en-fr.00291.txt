madam president we have watched zimbabwe's slow agony for many years
in addition to political violence and deepening poverty we now see it speed up as we see the inevitability of starvation and disease gripping the five million inhabitants
we must be there for the people feed them bring them medical relief and support their yearning desire for freedom
to help them we must isolate its leader mugabe from his african supporters by getting all african leaders to condemn him
beyond africa we must work to remove the international supporters the usual suspects china and russia by challenging them to cut off all support and trade with mugabe
we have to examine our own conscience though because it is not so long ago that we the eu invited mugabe to attend the eu-hosted au-eu summit in lisbon
