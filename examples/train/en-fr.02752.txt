the european union has for a long time been a promoter of gender equality
in support of this the commission has a well-established practice for widespread consultation both within and outside the commission
in particular the consultation of all commission departments allows for consideration of gender equality aspects of all legislative proposals and other initiatives including in relation to climate change
the commission recognises the serious social impact upon women of climate change as well as the important role of women in combating climate change
the commission back in october two thousand and nine called for there to be a platform for women to make their voices heard in particular as agents in the fight against climate change
in addition to this the commission is working closely with member states and the eu presidencies for the development of indicators for the follow-up at eu level of the twelve areas of concern of the so-called beijing platform for action
in this respect in the strategy for equality between women and men twenty ten twenty fifteen the commission has designated the development of indicators in the area of women and the environment among the priorities of the future work of the european gender equality institute
we also understand that in the first half of next year the danish presidency wishes to develop indicators in this field with a particular focus on climate change
a report is to be prepared by the european gender equality institute and specific conclusions could be adopted by the council on this issue towards the end of the danish presidency semester
so climate change and women is very much on the agenda
