madam president i welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this because of the absolutely brilliant address that we heard from the president of the czech republic
he reminded us of the history of his and many countries particularly in eastern europe which were occupied by the nazis and then effectively by the communists
that really demonstrates the vital importance of nato and its maintenance
the european union has a role in society but the principal defence of the west is still nato and it is so because it is our alliance with the united states of america
one of the disturbing features of this parliament which i find on so many issues is an undercurrent and sometimes overcurrent of anti-american feeling
it was the united states that ensured that we are speaking here as free peoples and nato guarantees that vital alliance for the years to come
