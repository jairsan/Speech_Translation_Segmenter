mr president i and my ukip colleagues abstained on the amendments to the guillaume report on granting and withdrawing international protection but one should not take this as indifference
this report is a development of the common immigration and asylum policy under the lisbon treaty
i do not want the lisbon treaty or a common immigration and asylum policy
the peoples of europe do not want a common immigration and asylum policy and that is why they were denied a referendum on the lisbon treaty
i abstained on the amendments because it would have involved endorsing existing eu law and a nit-picking exercise to decide which bits were worse than others
i leave it to the quisling meps of the conservative labour liberal democratic and green parties to haggle about the terms of surrender of their country
i and my ukip colleagues voted no to this report and no to a common immigration and asylum policy
