mr president i know ms de keyser's position on this and i respect it
it is more than i received from her in relation to my view
we have to have respectful debate in this house where people hear each other's views and then we come to conclusions
i have not heard anybody from the socialist or liberal side raise in this house the issue of gender-based abortion
not only did they not raise it they voted down a resolution put to this house not to fund infanticide or coercive abortion
it is a shameful occurrence on the record of this house for those people who did it
please let us have respectful debate in this house
that is what this european union is supposed to be about unity in diversity
