madam president there has been much talk in this chamber this morning about developing countries playing their part in tackling climate change and that is indeed true
like many others i would draw attention to the fact that in order for this to happen in regions of great poverty this house the council and the commission will have to take cognisance of the cost involved and there will have to be a strategy in order to tackle this
however i would not like to leave this house without saying that in areas like my own in northern ireland areas of high energy costs there also needs to be some work done to take account of those who are disadvantaged where there are high levels of fuel poverty amongst disadvantaged people where we have an economic base which relies on small business when considering the costs of tackling climate change
