this is a very important but also a rather technical question
in the case of multiannual programmes the suspension of budget commitments would not have an immediate impact as payments can be made against related commitments within a period of usually two years
this should protect ongoing projects under multiannual programmes and provide sufficient time for the member state concerned to take corrective action in line with the council recommendations within the edp
the funds would be rebudgeted as soon as the member state meets the council's recommendations
a definitive loss of payment would only occur if the member state fails to comply with the council's recommendations
moreover in line with the communication of thirty june the new sanction mechanisms should exclude a situation where the reduction of eu spending would lead to a reduction of farmers and fishermen's income
the concrete proposals on the range of relevant expenditure categories and the design of the sanction mechanisms will ensure that this condition is met
