madam president we debated earlier the deteriorating human rights situation and brutal fascist regime in iran
we heard in that debate how the mullahs have exported terrorism to palestine and lebanon and how now they are exporting their vile brand of terror to yemen
in late october yemeni officials reported that they had intercepted a vessel laden with weapons from iran
they arrested five iranian instructors
the weapons and the instructors were destined for the houthi rebels
iran is a past master at fighting wars by proxy it did so in both palestine and lebanon
now it wishes to foment a proxy regional conflict with sunni-dominated saudi arabia
i would say to baroness ashton that if she deals decisively with iran she will cut out much of the malignant cancer that threatens the middle east
