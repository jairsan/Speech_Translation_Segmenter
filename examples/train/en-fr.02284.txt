madam president i stand here as a democrat and someone who believes that greater participation in the democratic process is to be encouraged
let us be honest there is a disconnect between policymakers and citizens
it is therefore very important that the voice of the ordinary citizen is heard
the eci in theory is a sound concept yet my enthusiasm is tempered with the fact that the commission still holds considerable power
we also cannot ignore the fact that the mechanics for gathering the signatures for an eci even with the requirement for participation reduced to a quarter of the member states may mean that it is very difficult for anyone but large lobby organisations which already operate on a pan-european basis to gather these required signatures
this truly needs to be a tool of the citizen and not the ngo
