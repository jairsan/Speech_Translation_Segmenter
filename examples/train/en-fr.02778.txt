mr president the previous speaker said that if greece were to leave the eurozone its currency would collapse but in that case it would default
however we know perfectly well that it is going to default anyway so it has a choice of defaulting within the euro which merely kicks the problem down the road and it will return to bite us or it can default outside the euro in which case it can solve its problem
so his solution will not work
