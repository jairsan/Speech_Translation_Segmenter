madam president the european citizens initiative eci is a much needed sign of engagement by the eu and is a great opportunity to increase democratic participation in europe and to strengthen the links between citizens and politicians
although the obstacle of the obligation to provide passport numbers remains applicable in two-thirds of the member states i and other members of the ecr group have helped make this citizens initiative more user-friendly by deleting the terribly bureaucratic double admissibility check proposed by the commission and ensuring that the eci was made available to popular movements and not just large organised interest groups
now truly grassroots initiatives stand a change of succeeding even if they do not follow the spirit of european federalism
most importantly the commission will be obliged to indicate the exact reasons for refusal of an eci as well as indicating exactly how it intends to follow up on a successful initiative
transparency in this process is key
it is about time that the european union began to properly acknowledge the views of european citizens and listen to the voice of the people
i am hopeful that this scheme will engender a greater sense of democracy and of the democratic accountability of the european commission and inspire discussion on the future course of the eu
