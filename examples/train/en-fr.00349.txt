thank you commissioner not only for your response but also your comments in relation to marian harkin's words on food security
i think it is a big gap in the market
let me draw your attention to the report i drew up and which was voted through in this parliament today by an overwhelming majority of people supporting the cap and its role in global food security and to the discussion we had about falling dairy farm incomes
we need to have some reality check here on those who suggest wild reforms
we are talking about food for european citizens and incomes for those who live and manage the rural environment
i would like you to bear those in mind as we go forward
