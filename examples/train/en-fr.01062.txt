mr president i would like to thank the commissioner for his response
in fact it was not related to the previous question i was taking a different angle
the commissioner touched on two points that i wanted to bring up first of all with regard to the nutrition and health group that is meeting with regard to types of food and dietary conditions but also with regard to false advertising by many people involved in saying that sport is linked to certain types of products and additives which can be very harmful to health
instead of using natural products to create a better healthy environment for those people who want to train in sports they are using supplements such as growth hormones condensed into certain drinks and high-performance drinks which are sold on the basis that they give you extra pep or extra zip but in reality cause huge health problems
this is why i wanted to link the very finest of sport and what sportsmen and women do to get to the condition they are in while also encouraging those at lesser levels of sport to understand that taking a quick drink is not going to make you the best sportsperson in the world
