mr president it is human nature when something unexpected happens that we try and fit the facts into our existing the psychiatrists have a fancy phrase for it an even fancier phrase than they call it cognitive dissonance
thus for example when there is a no vote in a referendum the reaction of this house is to say that the people wanted more europe
they were voting no because this did not go in a sufficiently federalist direction
and so it is with the current economic crisis
we are in a crisis because we have run out of money
we have spent everything we have exhausted our treasuries we have exhausted our credit and now the house comes along and says that we need to spend more
we need more european infrastructure projects we need a higher budget
mr president that is another dose of the medicine that caused the illness in the first place
we have seen since the nineteen seventies where that process leads
it leads to a reduction of gdp it leads to unemployment it leads to stagnation and it leads to this part of the world falling further and further behind its rivals
