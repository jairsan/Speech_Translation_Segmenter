mr president in the original list what is the justification for placing the taliban in the same category as osama bin laden and al-qaeda
osama bin laden and al-qaeda are terrorists who have already committed terrorist acts worldwide and intend to commit more in the future
we must pursue those people to the ends of the earth and restrict them as much as possible
whilst the taliban are an appalling repressive and anti-democratic organisation the world is full of unpleasant regimes and the taliban are not even in government
they are also killing and maiming our troops in afghanistan for which they are quite rightly hated
however they would not be killing and maiming our troops if our troops were not deployed there
the taliban as far as i know have no ambitions beyond their borders
is there not a danger that placing the taliban in the same category as al-qaeda provides ammunition for the warmongers in the us and british governments to pursue a pointless murderous and unwinnable war in afghanistan for years ahead
furthermore wars against muslim countries only provoke terrorist outrages
returning to al-qaeda for a moment there is considerable doubt about its existence as an organisational entity as distinct from an ideological one
there is no possibility of drawing up a definitive and inclusive list of its operatives
the only strategy is to be watchful of those communities from which it recruits regrettably including innocent people as well as the guilty
