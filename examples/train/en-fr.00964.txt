i have indeed been discussing with the united states and with china from which i came last week buy american and buy chinese two very different programmes at least that is what i am reliably informed
i have read the legislation for buy american
i am concerned much more about the implementation by individual states in the united states than i am by what it actually said
buy chinese is a different proposition
i am reassured to some extent by what both the trade minister chen deming and the vice-premier tang jiaxuan said to me last week about the objective and the way in which european businesses would be treated but i remain vigilant to make sure that neither directly nor indirectly does european business suffer
in terms of the current position on tyres which i think the honourable member is referring to we are just watching that at the moment to see exactly what will happen
the honourable member is right to point to it as an important area that we need to keep an eye on and see what happens and obviously i am happy to keep in touch on that
