mr president the adoption of the report by ms kla√ü would undoubtedly see an explosion in rat populations jeopardising sanitation in homes and on farms
rats carry diseases such as e-coli and salmonella and can cause significant damage to property in some cases leading to electrical fires
farms especially fall victim to rat infestations without effective pest extermination
anti-coagulants are the most widely used method of rat poisoning and are by far the most effective accounting for around ninety-five of rodent control
in may i directed a written question to the commission requesting formal acknowledgement of the implications of a ban and sought a support framework for those affected as well as indications as to possible alternative pest control
the commission stated they were open to discussion with the aim of ensuring that appropriate solutions were found
what kind of solution does the commission propose
has there been an impact assessment into the prohibition of anti-coagulants as rodenticides
will there be a viable support framework and have alternative rodenticides been identified
