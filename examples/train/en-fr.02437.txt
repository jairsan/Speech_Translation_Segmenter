mr president the services directive has been consistently opposed by my party
this non-legislative report emphasises that this directive has the potential for further integration of the eu economy
the report recognises that the directive's impact on the economy businesses and citizens cannot be evaluated until it has been transposed in all member states
the report therefore calls for closer thorough monitoring by the commission with regular implementation reports
it envisages appropriate funds in its draft budget for twenty twelve to launch an eu-wide awareness campaign plus training schemes for officials
the proposals contained in this report outline more regulation more supervision and more expenditure at a time when the peoples of europe are being asked to accept more austerity
this is just more unreality more bureaucracy and more dismay
