madam president it is now less than five weeks since farai maguwu was detained by the zimbabwean authorities
since then he has been kept in detention in unknown conditions and deprived of his personal rights
i am happy that this parliament is united in asking for his immediate release but i am concerned that his arrest could be a setback to the results of the tel aviv meeting and to the kimberley process
as our colleague mr van orden mentioned there is systematic abuse of workers in diamond mines and the situation in zimbabwe is very typical with huge earnings from mineral exports not being reflected in the living conditions of the population which is kept in poverty and experiences disease
i also agree that african states have an important role to play in improving conditions there
i support dialogue with zimbabwe by the european commission on condition that mr maguwu be released and the kimberley process addressed by the zimbabwean authorities
