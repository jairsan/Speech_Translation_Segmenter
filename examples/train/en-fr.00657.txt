mr president the eu's relations with belarus are rightly now being driven by pragmatic considerations on both sides
years of isolationist policy led nowhere as the council has somewhat belatedly now realised
it certainly did nothing to loosen the grip on power enjoyed by europe's last self-isolating dictator president alexander lukashenko
two weeks ago here in strasbourg i had the privilege to meet two prominent dissidents from belarus to discuss political developments in their country
one of them alexander kazulin had recently been released as a political prisoner which is one of the reasons why the eu has begun to look at lukashenko in a more favourable light
but political repression still remains a serious problem in belarus
it is therefore open to question whether this apparent thaw in relations between the eu and belarus will lead us anywhere as lukashenko may well be playing a game with russia as he leans more towards the eu
but it is better than our sticking with the failed boycotting policy of the past decade
it is essential that the council maintains a carrot-and-stick approach to belarus if lukashenko is offered clear incentives for internal political reform he may well respond favourably
but equally he needs to know that he cannot carry on as before and that any sign of increased authoritarianism and repression will cause rapprochement to cease and reduce support by the eu for belarus's wto membership ambitions
at this stage inviting lukashenko to prague for the may summit to launch the eastern partnership to which belarus belongs could be a step too far in my view
we need to link closer relations to tangible commitments on the regime's part to change its ways
belarus must also be persuaded that recognition of the georgian regions of abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states as at present is the case only by russia is unacceptable
i believe that belarus is seeking to distance itself from russian control and we need to take advantage of this window of opportunity
undoubtedly promoting genuine change in belarus demands patience and commitment on the part of the eu but the prize belarus back in the european family of nations is well worth aspiring to
