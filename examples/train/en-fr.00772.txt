mr president let me be clear i support the extension of copyright from fifty to seventy years
my problem is who benefits
i welcome the fact that as demanded by the musicians union session musicians are going to get twenty of the profits for distribution
the problem is the balance between the multinational record companies and the featured artists
many of these people signed contracts thirty or forty years ago that gave them eight of the dealer's price with the companies responsible for producing distributing and collecting the money from sales
now these selfsame multinational record companies will get a multi-million-euro windfall for doing absolutely nothing because in this new digital age there is nothing to do
on the basis of an industrial structure long made redundant by technological change it is the sheriff of nottingham winning not robin hood
these artists should have been able to reclaim their property that they alone were responsible for creating
