madam president what matters are policies and not who applied them
let him cast the first stone the crisis of the euro may not end with ireland and we may have not seen the worst yet
the market predators will never endlessly attack any vulnerable opening despite the painful austerity measures taken by all member states
but if the eu wins this battle and succeeds in adversity by demonstrating determination to do whatever it takes in solidarity and concerted effort to thwart regulators and convince the markets then this would be the triumph of european integration and a great victory
this will be achieved as a result of collective wisdom
let us prove wrong those who predict the end of the euro and the withdrawal of countries strong and weak from the eurozone
fiscal discipline economic governance and the rescue of the euro will be incomplete without a mutually agreed plan at european level to stimulate growth
in the past an american marshall plan saved the economy of europe
the challenge today is an equivalent from europeans for europeans
