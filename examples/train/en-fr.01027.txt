mr president i must correct mrs joly when she said that the committee on fisheries voted unanimously to reject this proposed partnership agreement with guinea
in fact it voted by just one vote to do so
quite astonishingly the ppe group voted solidly to retain the agreement
this is an agreement which puts some hundreds of thousands of euros into the hands of this regime in order that we can take tuna from the coast
like many of these agreements it is a shabby deal at the best of times and in the present circumstances it is utterly unacceptable
the minister mentioned possible sanctions to be taken against guinea
will she now add this to her list and give us an undertaking that she will fight to try and ensure that this partnership agreement is suspended
