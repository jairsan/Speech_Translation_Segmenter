yes we have indeed discussed this in the council several times
there is a quite unanimous view that for the sake of the quality of the project there should be an element of national financing as well
therefore the proposal to eliminate that has no support from the council
however we are aware of the situation and of the problems
we have asked the commission to present an alternative proposal
i brought that up with commissioner samecki who is responsible for it just two days ago
they are working on such a proposal and will present it as soon as possible
