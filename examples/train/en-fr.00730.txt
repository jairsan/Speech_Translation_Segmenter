mr president can i start off by first of all thanking the committee on the internal market's shadow rapporteurs from all the groups their staff and advisers
i think that in the internal market committee we can all be proud that we have reached a consensus on increased transparency and ways to finally eliminate the problem of bill shock
bill shock was not good for the reputation of the mobile operators but more importantly bill shock was not good for consumers
however when it comes to price capping i still have some concerns
we need to ask which consumers will benefit from the soviet economics of price caps
given that at most only thirty-five of consumers actually roam and that the figure for regular roamers is much lower and as the commissioner herself admitted given that this legislation will mostly benefit a narrow group of privileged consumers such as commission officials meps lobbyists and businessmen let us hope that we are not robbing the poor to pay for cheaper phone calls for the rich
