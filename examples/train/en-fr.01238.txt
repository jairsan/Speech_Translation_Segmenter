mr president as you probably know romania has recently concluded a two-year period in which different elections were held every six months
the last electoral consultation was presidential and was won by the current president with the very narrow margin of seventy zero votes coming mainly from the diaspora
what bothers me as a citizen is that during the entire electoral campaign i was not able to post anything critical of the current president on my blog the europolis while public access to my blog was interrupted altogether
i consider this unacceptable both because it represents censorship of the right to free speech and because it shows that the internet too is controlled by those in power and or their supporters
all in all it is regrettable that twenty years after the revolution in which many people died so that democracy would take firm root such attitudes are tolerated possibly even encouraged by those who temporarily enjoy the fruits of democracy being elected to power even with such narrow margins
