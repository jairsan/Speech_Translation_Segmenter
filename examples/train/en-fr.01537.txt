as you know we have been working over the years to reduce financial errors in the accounts of the european union
many of those errors as you know are the responsibility of the member states in the implementation of many european programmes
i am encouraged by the recent opinion given by the european court of auditors recognising the progress made so far but i believe that we should not be complacent in this area
we are ready to work to reduce all kinds of errors in the implementation of the european union budget
