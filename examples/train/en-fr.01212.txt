madam president i just want to comment on two matters raised in the debate so far
first the link between hunger and climate change
as ban ki-moon said in rome at a time when the global population is growing and our global climate is changing by twenty fifty we will need to produce seventy more food yet the weather is becoming more extreme and unpredictable
so any positive efforts we make on climate change will impact positively on food production
another issue raised once again is the easy option blame the cap as if the cap were responsible for all of the ills of the developing world
the cap is not perfect but it has been reformed
if we want our farmers to continue producing and ensure food security for europe we cannot by regulation and withdrawal of support literally force them out of business
for example has anybody done a study on the recent reform of the sugar industry in the eu to see if the decimation of the eu sugar industry has benefited those in third world countries or if it has just benefited the sugar barons and landowners while leaving the small sugar growers in poverty
in no way do i want to minimise the issue of world hunger but we need to ensure that when we put forward solutions to the problem they actually do alleviate it
