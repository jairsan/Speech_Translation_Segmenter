mr president at his very first press conference following his appointment as president of the european council herman van rompuy celebrated the fact that two thousand and nine was the first year of global governance and he looked forward explicitly to the copenhagen summit as a step towards the economic global management of our planet
it is a pity that a number of people have jumped onto the environmental agenda as a way of advancing a different agenda an agenda that has at its core the desire to take power away from elected national politicians and concentrate it in the hands of international technocracies
the tragedy is not just that we become less democratic it is that we lose the consensus that we might have had for tackling environmental problems
left or right conservative or socialist we can all agree that we want a diversity of supply for energy and that we do not want pollutants being pumped into the atmosphere but only one set of policies is being applied those that involve statism and corporatism the same policies in fact which have failed politically and societally are now being applied to the environment
the environment is altogether too important to be left to the left
