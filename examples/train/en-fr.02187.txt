madam president we are discussing an issue which exists in almost all countries where minorities live namely the preservation of a language culture and equal access to education
that is about reconfirming our values mr b√ºtikofer
before addressing the issue of tibet allow me a quick word on our bilateral relations with china
our strategic partnership is strong which permits us to tackle all issues including the most sensitive ones
we have constructed an impressive framework of high-level interactions where we regularly address the global challenges that our citizens are facing without however neglecting the issues where our views may differ
the overall situation in tibet is one of those where we differ
the moves to institute chinese as the main language of instruction in tibetan areas raise complex and sensitive issues
china needs to strike the right balance so as to allow the effective instruction and preservation of the tibetan language as a living language for maintaining education in the tibetan language and as the mother tongue in tibetan areas while at the same time teaching chinese in parallel to give tibetan students decent chances of future employment
the remoteness of tibetan areas does not make this task any easier
we sincerely hope that china will ensure that tibetan is used as the main language of instruction in schools in tibetan areas and ensure the protection of minority languages in the other parts of china in the same way
seeking the view of experts and avoiding discrimination and the influence of ideology are good recipes for the way forward
the eu is ready to share its expertise should china so decide
we hope and here is my direct response to have a frank discussion with the chinese authorities on this very issue at the next round of the eu-china human rights dialogue
it is most important that china should allow open public consultation in order to allow those affected by any changes to language policy to freely express their opinions which would have to be taken into account
we have followed also with deep concern reports of the detention of several tibetan students and teachers who peacefully demonstrated in protest against the government's education reform plan
we urge china to release the detainees and to enter into discussions with tibetan civil society on the merits of the proposed reform
as a final point i would like to recall the eu's long-standing position with regard to tibet
the preservation of tibet's unique culture language religion and traditions and the need to achieve a system of meaningful autonomy for tibet within the chinese constitution remains a top priority for the eu
these are issues that we are persistently trying to address in the framework of our political dialogue with china
