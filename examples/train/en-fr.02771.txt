madam president after two long years of hard work the novel foods regulation has collapsed in disarray because a suitable agreement on the cloning issue could not be found
throughout the conciliation proceedings i had warned that the stubborn refusal to compromise would lead to disaster and eventually it did
now we are back to square one and we have lost a considerable amount of important and beneficial legislation on novel foods
conciliation proceedings are most certainly a useful mechanism in the legislative process but they become futile and pointless if participants are not prepared to negotiate and to compromise
if the parliament had not been so inflexible then we would have a much needed update of the rules
now we have to fall back on the nineteen ninety-seven novel foods regulation which is completely outdated
if the european parliament is trying to show that it is a powerful responsible legislative body which is proud to have achieved the lisbon treaty i think it flunked its first test
the commission now has to move forward and prepare separate legislation to cover cloning
i only hope that meps will learn from their mistakes and realise that it is the people of europe who suffer if we cannot agree on these key issues
