madam president on page seven of the europe twenty twenty document it says europe has many strengths we can count on the talent and creativity of our people
it does not of course say that other people are less talented or creative that would be terribly unkind and almost certainly unfair but it certainly singles out the population of europe for special praise
elsewhere it bemoans the fact that europe has an ageing population
this of course is attributable mainly to sharply falling birth rates though the document does not say so
perhaps nation states should encourage as far as states can a rise in the birth rates of their populations
this would certainly redress the population balance
furthermore it might even produce at least a proportionate increase in those talented and creative people who are so necessary for economic and cultural development
i do hope i am not tainting the commission document by linking its parts with reasoned argument but i have kept within my time limit
