madam president my region of south-west england is blessed with a particular blend of climate and landscape which produces good grazing and excellent beef
british farmers are amongst the most efficient in the world and they work after bitter experience to the highest standards of animal welfare and traceability
all these factors coupled with a growing world population and increased efforts to ensure food security should mean that they are a happy lot
nothing could be further from the truth
they find themselves under attack on many fronts
only this week we see that this parliament will be entertaining the vegetarian lobby claiming that meat eaters and by association farmers are climate criminals
yet they see the eu failing to be rigorous in dealing with countries where they are clearing rain forests to raise cattle
how can the consumer see any logic
beef farmers are not asking for special privileges just a level playing field
it is absolutely vital that we support them not by protectionism but by making sure that all exports to the eu match their high standards
i urge you commissioner to sharpen up your act stiffen your backbone reread your fvo report and deliver
