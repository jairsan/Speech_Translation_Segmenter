mr president first of all i would like to thank the rapporteur mrs corbey and the french presidency for their tremendous efforts in securing agreement on this ground-breaking dossier as part of the fight against climate change
i would also like to pay tribute to joseph daul whom i am replacing for his hard work in drafting the opinion of the committee on agriculture and rural development on this corbey report on fuel quality
ultimately the agreement reached on this report and the closely linked turmes report on renewable energy are ones which we in the agricultural world can be very satisfied with
i believe that there is a future for the sustainable biofuel industry and that these two directives provide the necessary legal framework for the industry to develop to allow in the future a transition to more second-generation biofuels
i welcome the fact that we are now committed to a target of a twenty share of renewable energy in the eu overall energy mix
i very much welcome this report
