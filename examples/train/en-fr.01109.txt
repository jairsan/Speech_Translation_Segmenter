madam president the pro-european government in the republic of moldova cannot be left to become victim of the serious economic situation
i call for more substantial assistance than the package already agreed to by the commission and i insist on this
financial assistance must support the population and must support the reforms which the country has to implement as encouraged by the union
these reforms need to be backed by enhanced and quick financial support from the union coupled with a monitoring mechanism to ensure and support the proper management of its funds
finally the new agreement with the republic of moldova should be an association agreement as in the case of the other countries under the european neighbourhood policy
visa liberalisation should be negotiated and helped to happen
