i should like to thank brian crowley for raising the question
i think you are certainly aware that the member states are in the first instance responsible for designing and implementing their employment policies
however the council has a number of responsibilities in the field of employment including the annual adoption of the employment guidelines in accordance with article one hundred and twenty-eight of the treaty
especially now that europe is facing a financial and economic crisis the council is paying special attention to the employment policies of the member states
you specifically asked in your question about the current initiatives by the european council to help combat youth and long-term unemployment in europe
in december two thousand and eight the european council agreed on a european economic recovery plan to provide a coherent framework for action to be taken at the level of the union as well as for measures adopted by each member state taking account of their individual circumstances
the european council's conclusion stressed in particular rapid additional action by the european social fund to support employment especially for the benefit of the most vulnerable groups in the population
the european council undertook to evaluate the implementation of the plan at its upcoming march spring council indicating that additions or amendments to it could be made if necessary
during the first half of two thousand and nine the czech presidency is paying particular attention to employment measures also within the context of the spring european council
the spring european council will consider the employment situation in the community and adopt conclusions thereon on the basis of the joint employment report adopted by the council and the commission
the opinion of the european parliament on the matter will be welcomed in view of the european council in march
based on the assessment of the european council the council will adopt the guidelines on the member states employment policies
the present employment guidelines adopted last year as well as previous versions have consistently stressed the importance of tackling youth and long-term unemployment in the member states
since the autumn of two thousand and eight when the effects of the present crisis on employment started to be evident the employment committee which was established by the council in accordance with article one hundred and thirty of the treaty has undertaken the new task of continuous monitoring of the member states employment situation
the committee's findings are being passed on to the council
moreover the presidency has decided to organise the employment summit so as to maintain a platform for the debate and eventual decisions and that will be held on seven may
topics for discussion will be confirmed after the spring european council so we are planning to have the orientation debate on this next week
it should also be mentioned in this context that during this year the european parliament and the council as the co-legislators are evaluating and considering amendments to the european globalisation fund an instrument aimed at the elimination of negative globalisation impacts where job losses certainly belong as well as decreasing the risk that redundant employees will become long-term unemployed
the aim is to avoid long-term unemployment by timely assistance to the employees affected through activation programmes such as training which would enable improved qualifications
on the whole promoting employment including fighting long-term unemployment and youth unemployment has always featured high on the agendas of the council and of the european council
the presidency supports the implementation of the flexicurity principles
their implementation to national policies together with continuing structural reform will help improve the situation of vulnerable groups in the labour market which include the young the elderly the long-term unemployed and people with low qualifications
the honourable member can be assured here that during spring two thousand and nine amidst the global financial and economic crisis and rising unemployment this continues to be the case
