mr president first of all let me congratulate mr belder for this very good report
your report comes at a time when the western balkans are moving closer and closer to the eu and provides a comprehensive overview of the issues at stake in eu-western balkans economic and trade relations
allow me to focus on some points highlighted in your report
the western balkans as a region is a key and valuable partner for the eu
the last commission communication on the western balkans in march two thousand and eight reiterates the eu's strong commitment to the european perspective of the region and confirms among other things the importance of the central european free trade agreement for the economic development of the region
the commission agrees with the rapporteur that the perspective of eu membership can act as a catalyst for sustainable economic development and for securing peace and stability within the region
the commission also agrees that the individual fulfilment of the copenhagen criteria is of the utmost importance when judging the readiness of countries in the region to join the eu
the eu is the western balkans main trading partner
deeper economic ties between the eu and the region are therefore vital for boosting the region's economic growth
as rightly pointed out in your report trade liberalisation and integration is a cornerstone in the stabilisation and association process and the eu has pursued this objective with the western balkans at three levels
firstly at the bilateral level the eu has granted unilateral trade preferences to the western balkans since two thousand so as to facilitate the access of their exports to the eu markets
the commission has negotiated free trade agreements as part of the stabilisation and association agreements to create the conditions for political and economic reforms and to set the basis for the integration of the western balkans into the eu for example by means of alignment to the
secondly at the regional level the european commission acted as a facilitator in the negotiations on the central european free trade agreement cefta and decided to provide financial support and technical assistance to the cefta secretariat and to the parties to help implement the agreement
at the same time the european commission values highly the regional ownership of the agreement and acknowledges that cefta is fundamental for deeper regional economic integration and for preparing the ground for the eventual full participation of the western balkans in the eu single market
moreover cefta created all the necessary structures to discuss trade-related issues at the regional and bilateral level
this is essential for facilitating and deepening regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations
the european commission will continue to monitor implementation of the cefta and will continue to report on this in its yearly report on the accession and pre-accession process
thirdly at the multilateral level the commission has supported the accession of the countries in the region to the world trade organisation as this is an absolutely fundamental step for effective participation in the globalised economy
the eu has mobilised all available policy instruments to support the countries of the western balkans in their endeavours for reforms and regional cooperation
the instrument for pre-accession assistance is important for addressing the region's long term development needs
the total funding for the current financial framework for two thousand and seven twenty thirteen is eur eleven point five billion
last but not least the european commission has started dialogues with all the countries concerned in the region to establish roadmaps for lifting the visa regime
in the light of what has been said let me assure you that the commission is taking all the necessary steps to enhance trade relations and to bring the western balkans economy as close as possible to the eu
in conclusion i wish to congratulate the rapporteur again for this good report and i am pleased to say that the commission shares its general approach
