mr president i do not really share your enthusiasm about frontex
we have heard reports from frontex as well as from member states that they have violated human rights the right to non-refoulement and given no possibility for refugees to apply for asylum and those violations of human rights are done in the name of the european union
minister billstr√∂m you have said that we need some checks and balances on our external borders but i ask you why cannot we have some checks and balances on those people who are working and defending our external borders
why cannot we have some transparency and clarity about frontex and what they are doing
we need clarity and transparency in this house in the european parliament about frontex's deeds
we need clarity about what is the stage of the procedure of the new rules of frontex that you mentioned commissioner and we need some clarification about how refugees can obtain international protection when they are intercepted at sea
we also need transparency about the deals that are being made with third countries and what happens exactly to the eu money that is being put into libya for example
i doubt whether what you called libya's assistance to refugees is actually helpful to refugees but here again we are just lacking transparency and if as you said not even member states interpret the rights of migrants the same way as you do then how are you going to make sure that third countries such as libya are going to follow your sort of interpretation
i would like to remind you that parliament has always supported the idea of making the sharing of responsibility to deal with asylum applications obligatory and i think your report of the pilot project where only france took a very very small almost ridiculous number of one hundred refugees from malta shows that we are not getting far with the voluntary solidarity
we need some obligation here
