madam president i believe there is no need for these agency supervisor posts because i believe there is no need for the agencies themselves
is creating another level of supervision called esma going to represent an improvement compared with existing supervisory authorities
i believe that by doing this we are only going to cause confusion about who is responsible for what
will the supervisory authority produce regulations suitable for the world's largest financial district
i doubt it
i think instead that the pet theories of the anti-market crowd will be adopted and forced upon the city of london
the problems caused by financial activity in recent years were due to rule books being either torn up or ignored by those whose job it was to enforce them
there is no guarantee that these authorities will do anything better
moreover we have been presented with only one candidate for each post a totally undemocratic exercise
of course it is the same that was used to appoint the president of the commission the rest of the commissioners and the high representative
i could go on with a long list
i encourage you all to vote against these or any other candidates
