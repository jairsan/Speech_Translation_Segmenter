mr president with twenty-two people dead in the eu and over two zero taken in for treatment as a result of the ongoing e coli outbreak across europe it is appropriate that this parliament extends its sympathies to those who have lost loved ones and our good wishes for a recovery to others
consumers demand food that is of good quality safe and traceable
the fact that the source of this outbreak is still unclear and that the search for answers has at times seemed haphazard means that consumer confidence is eroding fast
economically it is farmers who will suffer while this goes on farmers whose food is perfectly safe
we must also urge calm in such a situation
national governments have been quick to apportion blame
in the past we in the uk have suffered as a result of such scaremongering around our produce and this speculative blame game must stop
can i also say that this house constantly rushes to introduce regulation
before it does so we must have a full and thorough investigation of the facts
