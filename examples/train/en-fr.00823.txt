madam president we need to reject this proposal from the commission for three clear reasons
firstly they argue that regulation ec no five hundred and sixty-one two thousand and six on driving and rest time covers everyone and therefore there is no problem excluding the self-employed
this is wrong
driving time represents only half on average of the working time of a driver
those not covered could indeed end up working eighty-six hours per week every week of the year
secondly the hundreds of thousands of drivers driving vehicles of less than three point five tonnes are not covered by the regulation
worse still if they are excluded from this directive there will be no limits at all on their working time
thirdly the commission makes a distinction between self-employed and false <unk> and says it does this because you cannot inspect or control the working time of the self-employed
if that is so how will they control the working time of the false <unk>
this is an abdication of responsibility and an open invitation to unscrupulous employers to constantly search for new forms of false <unk> to avoid the law
we need to reject this proposal from the commission
