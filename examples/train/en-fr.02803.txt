mr president this well-researched report shows us in addition to all its conclusions that once again the first casualty of war is truth
what it fails to do is to outline the policies needed to heal the hurts of that nation
too many countries for too long turned a blind eye to what was going on
the right policies are needed now through a concerted effort by the international community to seek release and justice for all of those who have been so terribly affected
