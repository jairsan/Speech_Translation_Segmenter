mr president international protection is a coded and euphemistic term for asylum
the word asylum has rightly lost its glamour in the eyes of the general public
asylum seekers who pass by or through safe countries are migrants of choice not genuine refugees
people who come to europe simply because they come from unsafe countries might be unfortunate but europe cannot be expected to house the entire population of every unsafe country on earth
genuine asylum seekers should seek refuge in the first safe country one that will be culturally religiously and ancestrally related to them
the role of europe and the west should not be to act as a giant reception home for the vulnerable populations of the world
our role should be to stop creating the instability that fuels these vast population movements there must be no more wars such as those against iraq and afghanistan we must pull out of libya before we are drawn into a ground war we must cancel the planned conflict with iran and we must avoid encouraging discontent in other middle eastern states
