madam president i will be very brief
i thank the council for its statement
i would like to say that on behalf of the shadows of the other groups as well i think the european parliament is a serious partner fully available to give input in this process
however we will only issue a formal position once there are full satisfactory and detailed answers to all the concerns and objections that were raised on several occasions by the european parliament the european data protection supervisor the national data protection authorities the fundamental rights agencies and the airlines because i think they are entitled to a real answer
council has often pledged its commitment to the reforms of the lisbon treaty
i would ask the council in the absence of those reforms to act in the spirit of the lisbon treaty and to follow the recommendations of this house or to explain not so much to the european parliament but to the european citizens
eight years after nice decision-making on these issues in the area of police and justice cooperation unfortunately still takes place behind closed doors not subject to any meaningful democratic scrutiny
therefore i wish that the member states would show the same determination courage and resolve to democratic reforms as they did in the financial crisis
finally i appeal to my colleagues to endorse this resolution and give a very clear political signal to the council
