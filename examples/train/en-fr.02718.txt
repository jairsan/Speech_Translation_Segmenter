mr president my thanks to the rapporteur for this report
while i am generally in favour of the principle behind this report i would like to add that this vaccine should only be used when the competent authority identifies significant risk to the livestock population
in northern ireland both farmers and the department of agriculture and rural development have worked extremely hard to keep northern ireland a free area
it is important that the commission and the council recognise free area status within the eu and put safeguards in place for these areas
however there still remains a significant risk within europe that this disease may spread and as a result i believe it is necessary that northern ireland has the ability to use the vaccines
it is imperative that the competent authority monitor movements and impose trade bans where necessary to stop the spread of bluetongue and that good practice is followed by all of the actors
it is important that all member states work constructively together to reduce the risk of the spread of this disease and protect the industry from a major outbreak
communication between member states and the commission is a vital part of monitoring and controlling disease outbreaks
i would encourage this
