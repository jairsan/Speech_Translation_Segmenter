mr president i want to say a word on the need to include co emissions in the eurovignette
co emissions from heavy goods vehicles amount to almost a quarter of emissions from road transport and while cars are gradually getting more efficient hgv fuel efficiency has not improved in the last fifteen years
if we do not include co in the eurovignette what other options do we have
precious few because pigs will fly as we say before ecofin ministers agree on eu-level fuel taxation
worse still if a member state wants to bring in a toll system that reflects the external costs of co they will not be allowed to do so unless we now include co within the eurovignette
excluding co from the eurovignette would be particularly unfair given that all member states now have binding co reduction targets to meet under the effort-sharing decision
they need to have a range of tools at their disposal
