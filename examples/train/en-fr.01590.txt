madam president there are two brief points i wish to make
the first relates to the importance of investment in low-carbon technologies and the second to carbon capture in agriculture
firstly in realistic terms it is essential that the eu focuses its attention and budget towards the strategic energy technology plan
for the eu to reach its twenty twenty target figures there is no doubt that increased targeted investment in low-carbon technologies is essential
secondly there must be increased research and investment in carbon capture and storage as a practical way of combating climate change
here agriculture can play a key role in carbon sequestration and can contribute to the twenty twenty targets
soil biomasses and natural carbon sinking carbon in soil could bring added benefit for farmers by reducing erosion and fertiliser inputs
further research and investment is required in order to fully utilise agriculture and agricultural land to capture carbon and assist in reaching twenty twenty targets
for measurable results to be delivered innovation and research in low-carbon technologies must be adequately and effectively supported
