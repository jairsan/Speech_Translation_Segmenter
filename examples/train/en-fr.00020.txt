mr president i have a genuine point of order with respect to the new rules of procedure
we have been told that because debate has been curtailed we can now put in more written statements over the single written statement we were able to do before the new rules came into effect
today i tried to submit two written statements and the internet site will not allow it
so my voice in the debate for controlling energy has not been noted anywhere
can you make sure the technical problem is solved
the revised rules of procedure are not being adhered to
