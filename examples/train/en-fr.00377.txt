mr president i quote from a speech made on this subject by my colleague godfrey bloom on twenty-five october two thousand and six the thought the idea or the concept that the united kingdom's energy supplies could possibly be controlled by some sort of arrangement with a gangster like putin is absolutely ludicrous
it is absolute madness to expect anything from a piece of paper signed by putin
the man is a gangster
mr putin is now doing what any competent gangster would do withdraw supply and force the price up
europe will face two options be prepared to pay much much more for a precarious gas supply from russia or find alternative suppliers if that is possible
the uk must ensure its dwindling gas supplies are kept as a national resource and not allow them to become an eu common resource
we must also embark on a programme of building new nuclear power stations
