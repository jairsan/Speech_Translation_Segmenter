mr president let me respond briefly to many of the points that have been made
mr schlyter said he thought it was bad for european industry and it would result in more light commercial vehicles being built in asia
i have to say that i simply do not understand that remark
we are setting the most challenging targets in the world by far much tighter than the rules in the states or anything that exists in china or the far east
mrs wils compared this regulation with the passenger car regulation
in my view that is a false comparison
the opportunities to reduce emissions in passenger cars are much greater in terms of lightweighting and changing the fuel mix
there is already a much higher diesel penetration in the vans market
of course by their nature vans are already much more utilitarian and are bought by business customers
mr nuttall i am afraid has not stayed for the end of this debate but he is wrong in the figures that he has given
this will result in overall cost savings for many businesses
i have to say that i would have a little more respect for the remarks that he made if indeed the efd group had bothered to send a single representative to any of our trialogue meetings or to any of our shadow meetings to make the point that they are fond of quoting on behalf of small businesses
in conclusion i think this is a good result
it produces the best balance first of all in favour of costs for businesses but also in terms of environmental improvement
whatever view you take of climate change fuel efficiency using precious resources more efficiently has to be a good thing
