mr president the proposal exempting micro-entities from certain accounting requirements seems to be far from perfect and in the econ committee my group voted to support the econ rapporteur mr sterckx in asking the commission to go further to help all micro-entities and smes across the eu to materially reduce their burden by rejecting this proposal and bringing forward a much-needed review of the entire fourth and seventh company law directives in order to have a more meaningful proposal with more scope
the commission's impact assessment and its claims of how much good this proposal will do is also of concern
it seems that it has very limited reach
however in this time of economic hardship it is important to remember that every little bit helps
i am hopeful that if we support this measure at least one small business in my constituency in wales will find some benefit from this exemption
it will not be a silver bullet solving all the problems caused by the recession and we should not hold this tiny measure up as a huge achievement on our part
however if this exemption can help even a few businesses better weather these difficult economic times then we should not stand in its way
