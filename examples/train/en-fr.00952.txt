madam president as a new member of this house i have listened to the many speakers who have focussed on mr barroso's track record in office and have voiced many concerns
many i agree with
our paths diverge completely on the lisbon treaty mr barroso
however you have taken a great interest in my constituency of northern ireland
for this commitment i thank you
we value the support and close working relationship of commission officials at all levels with northern ireland
i look forward to this relationship continuing and my constituency benefiting from it
you will know about our past the impact of violence on investment and the need for new roads and rail links
you will know about the huge potential for the economy through the development of tourism
to aid our economic development i would urge the commission to examine what resources will be made available to redress the years of underinvestment
as many in this chamber have said already today it is actions and delivery that count
