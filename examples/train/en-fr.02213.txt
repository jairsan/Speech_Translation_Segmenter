mr president i cannot vote for any increase in the parliament's budget and i believe that many people in the united kingdom will be watching the proceedings here in utter amazement
in national economies across europe we have austerity measures and budget cuts
these are the order of the day and this is what our people have to face
the euro is in crisis and i want the house to note that even though my constituency does not use the euro we share a land border with the republic of ireland
the republic represents a huge export market for us so this crisis hurts our people as well
beside all this crisis we have a proposed two point nine increase limited from the six that parliament already wanted but on a budget that the court of auditors has not passed for many years
most worryingly of all we have a promise from the commission to bring forward proposals by june twenty eleven for an eu tax
is it any wonder that euroscepticism is growing
