commissioner i agree you need rules when you are part of a common currency but the stability and growth pact was put in place at a very different time
we have come to the verge of a global collapse and while some countries are recovering better than others certain countries like my own are still struggling
it seems to me here that we have all stick and no carrot
you are talking about a toolbox of sanctions but as my colleague mrs mcguinness said these will impact on citizens
i do not believe it is the way for the commission to proceed when some countries are still on the verge of economic collapse
