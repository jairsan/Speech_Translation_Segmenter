mr president tonight's debate looks at ways to improve a woman's lot sometimes by positive discrimination such as quotas sometimes by direct legislation on gender equality
i support references strengthening cooperation between member states in addressing wage discrimination for equal jobs and action protecting women and men against all forms of violence including human trafficking and female genital mutilation but we also need to see strong steps towards empowerment of women through increasing confidence in their abilities through education and through moves to create an environment which encourages choice
someone who once lived under the cloud of discrimination said i have a dream
well i too have a dream
i look to the day that we will work not only for greater equality in the workplace but to empower women to make a free choice and to feel strong enough to achieve their goals
that would be the true road map for women
however we must take small steps
we all agree on the principle of equality and i would say it is our basic right but why include issues which muddy the water
the dossiers are complex and the inclusion of issues which are member state competences such as public expenditure in the area of health does not help matters
there are red lines in the road
i am sorry to say that if we are to achieve equality we must ensure the road is clear of distractions for it is only on a clear road that we can march forward united
