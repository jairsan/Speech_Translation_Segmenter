mr president there are many reasons to vote against this resolution but too many to cover in just sixty seconds
we must of course oppose terrorism but that must not be used as an excuse for governments to spy on their citizens
the confidential information concerned belongs to the citizen not to the european union the parliament or indeed the nation state
any such agreement should be concluded between sovereign nation states answerable to their own people through the democratic process
in any case this is a one-sided agreement and we have no reason to believe that the united states will honour it
the agreement breaks uk data protection law which bans the sharing of information without consent between overseas third parties
the british government has an opt-out clause on this and i hope they overcome their usual spinelessness and oppose and vote against it in the same way i did
