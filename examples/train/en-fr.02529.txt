madam president my country ireland is a small open economy with a heavy concentration on foreign direct investment
the twelve and half per cent corporate rate is critical to supporting our economic recovery retaining our jobs and employment growth
as a result of establishing a low corporate tax rate eight of the world's top technology firms are based in my country
any move towards converging or harmonising the rate of company tax in the european union would substantially damage ireland's ability to attract foreign direct investment and hence our ability to grow to economic recovery
it is important to remember that ireland like indeed other smaller countries is geographically and historically a peripheral country in europe and a low tax rate is a tool a tool to address the economic limitations which come with being a peripheral country
i want to pose a question to the president
can he confirm that under lisbon tax competence is a matter for each member state
