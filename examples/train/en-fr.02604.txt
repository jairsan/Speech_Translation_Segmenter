mr president like other members here i am not a member of the committee on transport and tourism but i come from northern ireland an island on the edge of europe
you can therefore imagine how vitally important good air and sea connections are not only for our economy but also for personal travel
i have been dealing over the last number of months indeed even this week with residual cases from individual constituents who have been affected by this particular crisis
at the time of the volcanic ash crisis the costs were estimated to be in excess of gbp two hundred million a day in uk flights alone
therefore in order to avoid this we must have much greater cooperation and much more cognisance of best practice so that we have a plan in place to prevent future disruptions and such a horrendous impact on the economy
as i have said i have had a lot of complaints from individual constituents most of which centred on the airlines their treatment of these individuals and their failure to recognise their duty of care
i would ask the commission to look at this as well
