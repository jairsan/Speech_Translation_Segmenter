madam president this framework agreement on the relationship between the commission and this house introduced by the lisbon treaty in reality the eu constitution is said to bring about a more democratic governmental process
in truth it is nothing but an illusion of democracy where none exists
the following points are important
lisbon has no democratic or moral authority in the uk where the british people have been cheated by the ruling political class from giving their verdict on the treaty
the so-called changes in this agreement will in no way diminish the power and activity of the unelected and unaccountable commission supported by this compliant house
in practice the business of the eu will continue as it always has done in back rooms and behind closed doors
in due course the recommendation will be to vote resolutely against these proposals since we do not and will not recognise lisbon unless and until it has been submitted to the british people for their decision
that is real democracy
