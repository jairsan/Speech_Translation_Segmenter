mr president it is curious that whatever the crisis the answer in this house always seems to be greater european integration
most people beset by the economic squalls we have had in the past six months respond by seeing the situation as scary and possibly painful
however in this house we see it as an opportunity for more regulation more unification and more harmonisation at eu level as this report shows
the problem with this is that the people making that decision will be shielded from the consequences of it
living in their palaces and chancelleries surrounded and cocooned in their motorised convoys their chauffeured cars and their official banquets they will not be paying the price that our constituents will as a result of these economic policies
it seems to me axiomatic that we should respond to the economic crisis with more flexibility and by allowing countries to tailor their interest rates to suit their needs
instead we are doing precisely the opposite
