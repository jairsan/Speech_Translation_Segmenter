mr president we all know the importance of recycling and it is a given fact we would expect our paper to be recycled once used
i recently visited a printing company in my constituency of london where i found out more about ink-jet printing
the complicated process used to recycle ink-jet paper makes it an expensive operation and the use of additional bleach means it is not environmentally friendly
the ink cannot be separated easily from the paper which means that much of today's printed matter cannot be recycled
companies such as the one i visited in london that use other forms of printing which are environmentally friendly need to be encouraged and incentives offered to make the process economically more even-handed
i would like to see a market-driven solution supported by member states a solution where the industry self-regulates with a code of practice taking the lead in environmental agendas
nevertheless the eu has an important role to play in promoting awareness of these issues and supporting alternatives to ink-jet printing when and where appropriate
