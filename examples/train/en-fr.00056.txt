mr president in the northern part of european cyprus on the kyrenia mountain range there is a mammoth one-kilometre-long turkish flag not an eu flag to be seen
in fact in the whole of the northern part of cyprus there is a plethora of turkish flags present not eu flags
this is symbolic not of the unity of europe but of the division imposed by the turkish army on a small eu member state
with the eu-turkey accession negotiations in progress and with peace talks in cyprus under way pressure must be applied firmly on the turkish government by the eu to remove its troops and accompanying symbol from cyprus and allow our proud eu flag to fly freely in that corner of the eu
the eu flag in cyprus symbolises unity
the turkish flag symbolises division
let us all help to raise the eu flag in the whole of cyprus as soon as possible
