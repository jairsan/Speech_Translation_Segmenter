madam president if doctors and dentists and people like that want to come to the uk to work and we need their skills then by all means they should come but what we have at the moment is a situation where our market is saturated we cannot control who comes from the eu and who does not
this is fundamentally wrong
it is bad and it is putting people out of work
i shall give you an example
the taxi driver who drove me to the airport this morning was a bricklayer who has been laid off as a result of polish people coming onto the site undercutting british workers and now he is driving a taxi
that cannot be right
