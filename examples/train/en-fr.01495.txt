mr president since the end of the cold war a revolutionary new doctrine has imposed itself on the two hundred states that comprise the united nations
the idea has arisen that laws should not emerge from national legislatures which are in some sense connected to their populations but rather should be imposed by an international technocracy of jurists who answer only to their own consciences
we are reversing three hundred years of democratic development
we are getting away from the idea that the people who pass the laws must answer in some way through the ballot box to the rest of their populations and we are reverting to the pre-modern idea that lawmakers should be accountable only to their creator or to themselves
through these instruments of human rights codes these international bureaucracies have the ability to reach behind the borders of member states and to impose their own wishes at odds with those of the local populations
let me finish with a quotation from judge bork in the united states the quashed supreme court nominee under reagan who gave his name to the language when he said what we have wrought is a slow-moving and genteel but a none the less
