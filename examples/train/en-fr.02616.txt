mr president we have just heard from linda mcavan that she and the commission share the same view of how important it is actually to tackle emissions from transport that is also reflected in the white paper on transport which will be coming out today
unfortunately development of the implementing measure linked to the greenhouse gas intensity reduction target contained in the fuel quality directive has taken longer than anticipated
however the delay will not affect the ability of suppliers to meet their requirements under the directive as no member state has set an intermediate target for twenty fourteen
in preparing its proposal the commission has considered that the appropriate legislative approach needs to balance the accuracy and complexity of the reporting method with the degree of variability in the ghg intensities of different fuels
during last autumn and the first weeks of this year extensive internal discussions have taken place within the commission which are currently being finalised and thus a proposal could be discussed with the member states in the coming months
as concerns the default values for oil sands and oil shale i am pleased to report that the commission has recently published reports indicating an average default value for oil sands and a range of indicative default values for oil shales
these reports are available on the commission's website
given the wide interest in this matter the commission believes that it would be useful to subject these reports to a limited peer review process
in taking this issue forward i have liaised closely with my colleague responsible for trade matters to ensure that our approach is robust in terms of our obligations under international law and i will continue to do so
so without prejudging the outcome of the peer review process and the subsequent commission internal consultation it is the commission's intention at this stage to present a draft implementing measure to the relevant regulatory committee that will include default values both for oil sands and for oil shale as well as for other unconventional fuels such as coal to liquids and gas to liquids
it is also foreseen that the draft implementing measure states that the commission will examine the ghg intensity of other categories of feedstock with high greenhouse gas emissions and if scientifically warranted the implementing measure will be amended through the addition of new feedstock categories
this would make the measure non-discriminatory by demonstrating that the list of feedstock categories is open and that the commission is actively looking at other categories and is ready to extend the list when enough evidence and data is gathered on other categories
so given that some weeks are necessary for the peer review and subsequently the finalisation of the commission's internal discussions there will be some delay before the draft implementing measure of the whole package can be discussed with the member states
but as soon as it is approved by the regulatory committee the measure will be transmitted to the european parliament for scrutiny
