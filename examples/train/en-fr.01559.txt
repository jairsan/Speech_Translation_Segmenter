mr president the report proposes that member states may issue long-stay visas for up to twelve months for third-country nationals which will be recognised by other states within the schengen group
britain is not a member of the schengen group so would not appear to be directly affected
however the proposals would make it easier for the citizens of non-eu countries who enter one member state to travel to other eu states
britain has a massive problem with illegal immigration
there are at least one million illegal immigrants in britain
under these proposals people who wish to migrate to britain illegally may come to another eu state perfectly legally obtain a long-stay visa that gets them to france for example from where they may gain illegal entry into britain
the uk independence party meps will therefore vote against this report in the interests of protecting our borders against further illegal immigration
