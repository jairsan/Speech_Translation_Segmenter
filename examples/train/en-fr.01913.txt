mr president i also supported the bov√© report and can echo the comments of my colleague mr jahr
this sends a very strong signal to everybody both in politics and along the economic chain that the parliament here means business
we had a vigorous debate last night
not everybody agrees with the entire contents of this report but we are all in agreement that farmers cannot continue to be squeezed
the blood is literally being squeezed out of them at the moment
they are getting less and less of the final price that we all pay for our food in supermarkets and that situation has got to be stopped
we have got to look at the role of dominant players
we need an ombudsman for the food sector and we need to look at what the global market is doing to our food producers
we need to examine competition law
i am happy that this report got the debate and the support it deserved here in parliament
it is an important step to back up the rhetoric of recent times
