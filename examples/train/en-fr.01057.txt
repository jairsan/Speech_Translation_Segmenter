madam president recently the irish government decided to scrap the reps scheme for farmers that is the rural environmental protection scheme
that scheme like many more was cofunded by the european union
i want to know what happens to the money when it is not utilised by the particular government whether the same happens in other countries where this money goes and how is it utilised when it is not used within the country for which it is designated
