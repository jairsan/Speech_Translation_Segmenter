mr president when the eu ordered the postal sector to open up to competition it destroyed a vital british service
as a sovereign nation our post offices were run by the royal mail and linked with national savings licensing welfare and pension collection to name a few
in nineteen seventy-five we had twenty-five zero post offices
now there are fewer than twelve zero despite a population boom
after being forced to sell off their profit-making arm post offices could not stay open without government support
thousands shut stripping communities of access to vital services
the eu postal reform says that good quality postal services should be available throughout the union
that is exactly what we had in britain
as a consolidated enterprise the service was efficient prices were managed and everyone had access to it
now the sector has been broken up along with people's faith in it
it is a disgrace to strip britain of an efficient public service merely to satisfy competition law
do you wish to privatise our nhs as well next
the uk must be allowed to fully opt out of this directive
