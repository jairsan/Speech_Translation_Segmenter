mr president the commission report clearly points out that labour supply and demand determine the volume and direction of the workers rather than any restrictions on the labour market
furthermore it states that future immigration flows to the eu from bulgaria and romania are highly unlikely
these restrictions stimulate the creation of bad practices due to the vulnerability of the illegal workers who are easily exploitable
as commissioner de gucht said this flow of people would not change if it was made official but the result would be that they would pay social contributions and taxes
post-enlargement flows from bulgaria and romania have also been significantly outnumbered by recent immigration of non-eu nationals
obviously non-discrimination and freedom of movement are fundamental rights for every european union worker and it is an unfortunate fact that some eu member states as pointed out in the report have decided not to comply with these basic principles
i should like to stress something which is quite important tolerating second-class eu citizenship calls into question the integrity of the union as a whole
