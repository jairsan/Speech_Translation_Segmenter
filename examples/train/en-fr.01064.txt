mr president there are two overriding themes in this place first concern with the growing gulf between the political elite and the ordinary taxpayers
second a hysterical obsession with man-made global warming
these two themes are intimately linked
the global-warming fixation is a classic example of how the political class here is out of touch with the little people who have to pay the bills
while the eu backs the copenhagen proposals to further the deindustrialisation of the west and the corporate domination of the third world a growing majority of ordinary people regard climate change as an elite scam an excuse to tax and control us and to impose internationalist dogma and global government at the expense of the nation state
can you not see the danger in this growing gulf
it is time to look at the facts
man-made global warming is an unproven theory based on manipulative statistics
the so-called consensus on the issue is the product not of debate but of the suppression of expert dissent
before the political class and the green industrial complex dare to impose a single new tax poisoned light bulb or useless wind farm on the ordinary taxpayer they need to try to convince the public that global warming man-made that returning to the warmer climate of medieval times would be a bad thing and that there is something that europe as opposed to the united states china and india can actually do about it
either hold a debate and close the gap between you and the people or do not complain when we nationalists the ones who listen to the people close it for you
