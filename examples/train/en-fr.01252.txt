it was not a question so i do not have to answer but since i have the opportunity i will just say the following
the principle of loyalty between the different institutions is very important
also now that we have a new treaty we need to respect the competences of each institution
i told you how important it is to have a special relationship between the commission and parliament and i will work for that
this of course means respecting the competences of each institution in its own field according to the treaties
