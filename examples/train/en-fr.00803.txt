madam president following that exchange and your very helpful reply i was unable to catch your colleague's eye yesterday to report that the same member i decline to use the world honourable had published an article in the austrian press naming a member of parliament's staff
this seems to me whether the allegations are true or false to be yet another example of wholly improper behaviour
it may well be that the character involved would not have his credentials verified if the austrian electorate are foolish enough to support him
