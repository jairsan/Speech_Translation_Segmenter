mr president apparently a small german company bronchoair of munich has produced an inhaler which can actually improve the life of asthma sufferers who rely on such devices to breathe
this product has been shut out of the market for over fourteen years and the commissioner's account of why this has been was very different from that of the chair of the committee on petitions who opened the debate
the committee on legal affairs has stated and i quote the company has been the victim of a flagrant denial of justice on the part of the commission
why does the commission favour the big pharmaceutical companies and their lobbyists
in this case the uk independence party which i have the honour to represent strongly supports the immediate setting up of an inquiry into the commission's handling of this matter
