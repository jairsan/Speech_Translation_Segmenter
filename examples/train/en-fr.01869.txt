mr president i voted in favour of the resolution because i would like to join my colleagues in condemning the violence that erupted in kyrgyzstan last month
it is deplorable that hundreds of armed kyrgyz men stormed the city streets shooting civilians and setting fire to shops choosing their targets purely on the basis of ethnicity
i would like to extend my condolences to the families of the approximately three hundred dead and the two zero who were injured or hospitalised
it is important that the eu keeps pressure on the kyrgyz authorities to conduct a credible impartial and independent investigation into the violence
