indeed the two questions could almost have been taken together but the subliminal message i think in my irish colleague's question if i am doing justice to it is that he would like to see or that the legislation might favour first-generation investment or at least that we should not apologise for legislation favouring first-generation investment as that leads on to second- and third-generation
i would come at it slightly differently and i would like ask you through the chair commissioner should not all legislation in this area as a matter of principle be technology-neutral
