madam president in the time available i will focus on the milk sector because as the commissioner knows from our meeting last week it is in trouble in my constituency in light of the plunge in the price
that fall in price strengthens me in my view that abolishing milk quotas is premature and imprudent and will do nothing to stabilise the market
likewise reducing the range of available market-management measures seems to me unnecessary and foolish in light of the instability now affecting the market
we need meaningful market-management opportunities if a bottom is to be put and to be kept in this market
without this we are headed for anything but a soft landing for milk
i regret therefore that at a time when some member states are showing flexibility with france diverting underspend to the sheep sector and germany talking about a milk fund the commission wishes to bind itself by reducing its scope for action by needlessly abrogating market-management measures
