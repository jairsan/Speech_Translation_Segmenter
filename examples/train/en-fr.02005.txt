mr president i should like to thank mrs kla√ü
in my sixty seconds i can only mention two issues in this important and complex dossier
the first is the issue of pbts persistent bioaccumulative and toxic substances
biocides are by their nature toxic they kill something usually something nasty which is a danger to human health and often to animal health
so if anyone is tempted to vote in favour of amendment sixty-one which would make toxicity the lone criteria for substitution then beware you will be cutting across the whole rationale of protecting public health and the environment
this brings me to my second point the substance difenacoum
amendment two hundred and forty-three seeks to restrict the use of this rodenticide to professionals only
a quick look in my local store at the weekend confirmed this active substance to be in about half of the products available and all with clear instructions for use
rodenticides create resistance they need to be used in rotation to remain effective
taking one product away will upset this balance and could lead to a major public health disaster
please colleagues do not be instrumental in letting this happen
