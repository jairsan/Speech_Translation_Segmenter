madam president i think that when one considers the european project there is a dialectic at its heart
we talk about democracy yet we ignore the democratic will as expressed in referenda in france the netherlands and ireland
we talk about food security yet we vote on a report which has the potential to undermine food production in the european union
we talk about helping citizens and farmers in poorer countries yet there will now be as a result of this vote a call to ban imports from farmers who have used pesticides that are now banned in the european union
i simply have a plea to my colleagues in parliament and to the commission please let us think in future about the unintended consequences of our legislation
i agree with mrs wallis about the legislative process and that there should have been a third reading
i agree it has been rushed through and i think we all agree that there has been an insufficient impact assessment on a scientific basis
let us make sure that does not happen again
