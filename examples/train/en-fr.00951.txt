mr president mr barroso observed that we are living in extraordinary times true but extraordinary times call for extraordinary leadership
are you that leader mr barroso
i did not support you back in two thousand and four and unfortunately in five years you have not done enough to convince me
a majority of my group however is willing to give you the benefit of the doubt but we will reserve our final judgment until we have seen the full package of commissioners portfolios and the full details of your political programme because do not forget and i hope you hear the irony in this that the president of the european commission is a politician and not a civil servant with job security
regardless of the outcome of the votes this process has strengthened european parliamentary democracy because contrary to what some in this house fear obliging a candidate to campaign has not weakened but strengthened the position of commission president
because the way i see it a mandate by the european parliament for a political programme is a much more solid base than a nomination on the basis of a backroom deal between national governments
i also happen to believe contrary to you if i listened carefully that the emergence of a real opposition in this house is very welcome and a healthy sign that european parliamentary democracy is vital and mature
so mr barroso the ball is in your court
will you meet the challenge
because you have not convinced me yet
but that is not nearly as relevant mr barroso as convincing the european citizens in the next five years
