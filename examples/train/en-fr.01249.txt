two different questions one regarding the portfolios on justice and security the other on climate
regarding justice and security i have forwarded the suggestion made by many of you in this parliament to have a specific portfolio more centred on fundamental rights
so commissioner reding if she meets with your approval will be commissioner for justice fundamental rights and citizenship
there will also be a commissioner for home affairs which is basically what happens in most if not all member states in europe there is a minister for the interior and a minister for justice
i believe that it is much more efficient so that they can work with their colleagues in the respective councils
it will also be much better in terms of the amount of work because as you know we have just approved the stockholm programme
this is a very ambitious programme in which this parliament has a lot of important competences now so it is fully justified to have two different commissioners
it is not because of the role of the president in this case
it has nothing to do with the role of the president of the commission
it has to do with the need to have some kind of division of labour in such an important area
i would like the commissioner for fundamental rights to have security concerns in her hands and i would like the commissioner for security to do the job whilst respecting fundamental rights and the spirit of liberties in the european union
