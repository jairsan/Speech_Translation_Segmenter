mr president i want to deplore the deeply worrying decision of the turkish constitutional court on friday to close the democracy society party which represents largely kurdish interests and to ban from politics its leading mps
this is a very retrograde step and will be used as a pretext to return to violence by extremists
it closes off the democratic political option which the prime minister mr <unk> has said he wants to pursue
one of the problems is that the ak party government has failed to reform the very law which was used to close the democracy society party in fact the law under which the ak party itself almost got closed
so this is not in the interests of the government of turkey or its people
the alde group will be calling for a plenary debate on this subject as early as possible in the new year because it is a really bad step backwards for turkey
