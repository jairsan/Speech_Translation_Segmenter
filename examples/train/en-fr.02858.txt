mr president so the eu seeks to raise eu revenue by taxation on trucks
well i ask uk voters what they think of the eu and the usual answer is i do not think we should join
the uk has been politically taken over
uk law is made in strasbourg a monster red-tape factory is closing industry and now we have tax but because it is not football the people are not informed
the uk media avoid eu reality brains are fed with tv soaps and reporters say the eu does not affect local issues
the eu is not news
this report seeks to raise tax from tolls on trucks partly funding the trans-european ten-t project which includes linking high-speed eu trains
so when the eu raises taxes in the uk will the people respond by kicking the eu in the ballot box
no because they are not informed
the final eu superstate takeover by stealth will be a taxpayers <unk> into europe
the defences are down the press do not care and the uk is asleep so get those unfortunate truckers taxed
