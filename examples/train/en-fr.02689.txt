mr president we should not turn a blind eye to blatant human rights violations taking place in the three countries
the situation in syria is very serious and its stakes the highest
in syria teachers opposition activists journalists and bloggers are being targeted
there are many people killed many detained foreign journalists have been kicked out of the country an information blockade is in place no independent press at all
so we should consider sanctions against syria
we should also consider policy actions in yemen and bahrain
as for yemen we have a standing agreement on arms exports we should consider suspending this agreement
as we debate the situation in those three countries firstly let us call for accountability secondly let us have special sessions in the united nations human rights council in geneva
