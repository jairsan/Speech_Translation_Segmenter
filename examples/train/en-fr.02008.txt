mr president i am delighted that attempts to ban all anti-coagulants and rodenticides have failed
had such a ban won majority support it would have led as we have heard already to an explosion of rats and mice across europe with the consequent damage to stored crops farms and domestic properties on a large scale
it is estimated that seven per cent of all house fires and fifty per cent of all farm fires are caused by rodents gnawing electric cables
sadly the environment committee did adopt one specific ban of a widely used second generation anti-coagulant rodenticide
as we have heard that rodenticide is difenacoum
i hope the house will vote against amendment two hundred and forty-three so as to enable this effective rat poison to continue in use particularly as it has already undergone rigorous scientific assessment and has been through a proper and detailed regulatory process
