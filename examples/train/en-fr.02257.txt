madam president although the report encompasses many significant issues i would just like to touch upon the case of sergei magnitsky
his tragedy represents a great number of similar cases that have not come to our attention yet
it is essential to make it very clear to the russian authorities that such incidents must be investigated in compliance with the principle of the rule of law
instead the investigators and prosecutors involved in the death of sergei magnitsky have been promoted and rewarded
such a course of action is simply an incredible perversion of justice and the european union and its member states must not close their eyes to this
we should bear in mind the international commitments of the russian federation
therefore colleagues i encourage you to support amendment twenty-five which proposes to impose sanctions on sixty russian officials involved in the case until a proper investigation of the death of sergei magnitsky is conducted
