mr president yet again there is one rule for herr schulz and one rule for everybody else
this is a disgrace
i have been elected re-elected to vote in this chamber by the people of yorkshire your own constituency i might add with a democratic mandate which you yourself do not enjoy mr president because you switched parties and they voted for the conservatives
i have no intention of apologising i have no intention of leaving this chamber you must have me escorted out sir
