mr president i would like to start by thanking mr lehne for his report and to confirm that my group will be supporting that report
i would also like to say that i find it a little odd that we are having this debate late at night when we have a question on the same subject tabled for tomorrow morning
it would have made a great deal of sense to have put both together
however in complimenting the report let me say that my group's starting point will be doing justice doing justice for smes and consumers across the european union where they have to face inappropriate and anti-competitive action
a few weeks ago my group organised a seminar at parliament in brussels and i was very struck by certain of our visitors who were at the sharp end of such anti-competitive action ironically in the cement industry
what did they say
please please get on with this we need something that will allow us to pursue these inappropriate operators in the european market
we want a european solution and we want it sooner rather than later because if we do not get it my forecast and my warning is this some of our member states will develop systems that will lead to forum shopping as a result of free movement of judgements
so please a european system as soon as possible
