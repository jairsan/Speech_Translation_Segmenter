mr president the report on youth on the move contains some good ideas like the demand that the crisis must not be used as an excuse to cut education spending
however the report accepts the bologna process which has increased the stranglehold of big business and furthered the process of commodification of education
the rapporteur referred to the fact that universities are underfunded and therefore called for them to look for more funding from private sources
surely the answer to underfunding is not to invite in the private sector with all the distorting effect that has on education or to impose fees that block access to hundreds of thousands across europe but for state investment to provide free well-funded education at all levels
furthermore as a result of the brutal austerity in many countries it is virtually impossible for young people to get a decent job after finishing education
a quarter of young people in ireland are now unemployed and one zero people emigrate every week so for many irish families the very notion of youth on the move has a very different meaning
this unemployment crisis can only be solved on the basis of massive state investment to create decent jobs
