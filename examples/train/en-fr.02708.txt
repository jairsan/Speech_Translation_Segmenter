madam president i abstained on the twenty ten report on iceland
as a result of the financial and economic crisis iceland went from being the fifth richest country in the world to being a country racked by crisis with the collapse of its banking system where forty of households could not pay their bills and pensioners lost their life's savings
last year ninety-three of the icelandic population in a referendum rejected the notion of paying more than eur three point five billion to the governments of britain and the netherlands
despite some modifications they are faced with essentially the same deal in the vote to be held on nine april
they should not be bullied into accepting this deal the deal should be rejected
it is not the responsibility of the icelandic people to pay for the crisis
workers pensioners and poor people have not created this crisis and must not pay for it not in iceland not in greece not in portugal not in spain not in ireland nor elsewhere
those international speculators who profited massively from the deregulation of the financial markets must pay
