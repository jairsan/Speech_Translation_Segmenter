mr president i think it is fair to say that we are now in a new era of energy policy where there is a need for energy policy to be consistent with a policy for stopping climate change and at the same time to be combined with a policy for energy security
those three legs energy policy climate policy and energy security must function together
from my perspective this highlights the importance of nuclear power
it is important that the existing nuclear power plants are managed in as safe and secure a way as possible but it is also important that we have clear rules to ensure that the future power plants of the european union are as secure and safe as possible
this is not only a matter of preparing the ground for more nuclear power
i think that there is rather large support for such a policy in the european union that it is growing and that we need to live up to the responsibilities that this gives us all
i respect those who are hesitant about or are against the use of nuclear power but whatever opinion and whatever view we have on nuclear power there can be no disagreement on the need for the rules to be as safe and secure as possible for the nuclear power we have
it is from this perspective that i would like to present this report on the community framework for nuclear safety
there is a legal basis for this and there has been a debate in committee on whether all the procedures have been fulfilled
a letter has been sent from the committee on legal affairs to the committee on industry research and energy saying that if it is a new proposal then there is a need for a new opinion from the group of experts
my view and the view of the majority of the committee is that this is a revised proposal which we have been working on in the european union for nearly seven years
it has been changed because of an opinion from the group of experts and because of the opinion given by parliament and i must say that now is the time to reach a decision
i hope that council will be able to take this decision this spring
if we do not and if we delay this process we will see in reality that new nuclear power plants will be planned and constructed without this community framework
so this is the time for action
those who are trying to hinder this because of their attitude to nuclear power are in reality preventing the european union from having a community framework establishing as safe and secure rules as possible
i have tried to position my report in three ways
first of all to give a clear structure on the responsibilities of member states and governments licence holders and national regulators
secondly i have been very clear about the independence that the national regulators will have and i am strengthening the requirements on national regulators meaning that they must be able to act when they see any risk of a nuclear power plant not fulfilling the security rules
thirdly we are including in an annex the rules of the iaea as binding rules thereby making this community framework clear strict and firm and that is the note on which i end
