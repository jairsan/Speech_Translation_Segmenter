mr president i voted in favour of the resolution
i would like to commend the fact that the european parliament engages in discussion with the commission and the council on the very important issue of kosovo's future
kosovo can be considered the last piece in the complex balkan political puzzle
it is therefore vital that we put the piece in the right place and manage the process in a harmonious and peaceful way
the independence of kosovo has already been recognised by sixty-nine countries including twenty-two eu member states
it is important to note that eu integration prospects serve as the strongest incentive for the balkan countries to undertake necessary reforms and also as a factor for regional stability
kosovo is not an exception
therefore if we want to anchor kosovo in europe and ensure regional stability in the balkans it is vital that we come up with a common approach towards the whole region and kosovo in particular
