mr president i want to agree with tunne kelam and mr alvaro
the day of dialogue and engagement with iran has long since passed
people are dying in the streets almost every day in protests against this fascist regime
only yesterday as you have heard a kangaroo court in tehran called for the death penalty against five protesters arrested during the ashura riots on twenty-seven december
enough is enough
no more talk no more appeasement
we need tough sanctions
that is the only way that we will show the ordinary people of iran that we back their protests
