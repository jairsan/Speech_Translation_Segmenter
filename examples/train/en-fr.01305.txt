mr president on a point of order regarding my request on behalf of my group the ecr group to postpone the vote that mr schulz called for to fifteen to give us enough time to understand what this was all about
that was not actually put to the house
the president just put to the house the schulz motion and did not put my request for a motion to postpone it to give us two or three hours to cool down and find out the facts
i object to the fact that was not actually put to the house
