mr president this is a very important report i agree with the rapporteur that perhaps we could have been braver and pushed out the boat a bit more
as a member from a country that votes on every single treaty i am acutely aware of the need for a continuing active dialogue with citizens
it is my experience that more and more people are losing faith and trust in institutions
the eu represents a huge institution and we have a massive responsibility to ensure that active dialogue is core to what we do
i am particularly supportive of paragraph thirty-two and i thank the rapporteur for supporting my amendment on the fact that the european year on volunteering in twenty eleven will be an ideal opportunity for eu institutions to connect with citizens
we have called on the commission to submit appropriate legislation on preparing for twenty eleven and this they have started
we must now ensure that we have a meaningful dialogue with the one hundred million volunteers across the eu and ensure that their views and opinions will form the core of any new plans policies and programmes and that active dialogue with citizens will guarantee a strong solid eu
