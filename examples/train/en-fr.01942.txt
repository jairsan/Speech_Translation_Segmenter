mr president as the president of the commission acknowledges belief that the eu is a good thing has fallen substantially and many people believe their member states have not benefited from membership
we should be worried but i fear that the commission is under pressure from those who believe that the solution to every crisis is more europe
indeed some argue that polls demonstrate support for more european economic governance
however the public does not want more europe it wants a better europe and a europe that adds value with a light touch
the european union has been delegated by its member states with key functions that need to be achieved such as completing the internal market and furthering international free trade
those should be priorities and that is why we support the principles of president barroso's centre-piece initiative europe twenty twenty and the single market relaunch which members of my own group have been so involved with
