madam president as a member of eurolat i commend the spanish presidency and mr salafranca for emphasising the importance of our relations with latin america
climate change and global warming should remain a priority on the political agenda between the eu and the countries of latin america and the caribbean and a commitment to copenhagen targets should be reinforced
furthermore energy and energy-supply dialogue should be boosted to combat climate change and to aid sustainable energy consumption
but we have much to exchange not only in trade but in culture and education and the ultimate aim is that our trade relationship with latin america is boosted by increased innovation on both sides and improved education and i would like to emphasise the need to further enhance and promote erasmus to latin american participants and the fantastic opportunities that it can offer personally professionally and for future contacts and improved trade relationships between the eu and latin america
