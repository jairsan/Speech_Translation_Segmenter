madam president i have a couple of points
it is difficult to see how we can fit all of the resolution that we have set out on the tec into the tec
it is a very small operation as we know
i will be there next tuesday commissioner
i look forward to seeing you along with mr brok and other parliamentarians an issue i will come back to at the end
we do however have key issues which can be raised in the tec and can be dealt with as they are sufficiently upstream to borrow your words commissioner
financial services for example which are appropriate to deal with because the outcomes are very closely discussed and are near agreement not just in g twenty but ongoing discussions that we have in parliament and with the commission and the americans
in particular accounting remains one of these aspects within the reach of policymakers and legislators
adoption of high-quality global standards for accounting by twenty eleven is something which needs to be concluded quickly on the us side
on insurance too solvency ii has helped to set global regulation one which needs an answer frankly from the us side and i thank chairman kanjorski in the us congress for the work he has done on the federal office of information
finally let me just say on the transatlantic legislators dialogue that congress and parliament need to step up their game in this area
we do not want to follow the administration and the commission as most people in this house would agree
we want to be amongst the leaders for change
we need to be the impetus for this change
tec needs our support but the tld needs to be at the heart of the discussion not just on the side and not just as advisers but very much part of the central aspect of this whole transatlantic relationship
