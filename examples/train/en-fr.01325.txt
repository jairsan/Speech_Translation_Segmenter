mr president president ahmadinejad's ruthless ambition to develop nuclear weapons represents in my view the gravest threat to world peace today
only through a united and coordinated approach will the eu's diplomacy eventually succeed
renewed sanctions must now be targeted and must be extremely damaging to the regime in tehran
but equally we should recognise that iran's people and the iranian regime are not the same thing
since ahmadinejad stole the presidential election last year we have seen many dissidents and brave young protestors take to the streets
these people need our support because they identify with our values of freedom democracy and the rule of law
indeed such is the desperation in iran that opposition leader mir hossain musavi hardly known to be a democrat in the past has said he is prepared to sacrifice his own life for the future good of his own country
meanwhile outrageous human rights abuses continue unabated as juveniles and homosexuals are executed routinely
we meps in this house long to see a democratic and free iran which no longer exports terrorism via hamas and hezbollah and takes its rightful place in the international community
the eu should redouble its efforts to expedite that process in every way possible
