madam president i abstained on this important vote in this parliament
i am of course not in favour of illegal immigrants coming into our countries and taking the jobs of those who have paid their taxes and paid their way over time but i think the responsibility here should rest not principally with employers but with the national governments of the individual countries
it gives me the chance by that abstention to put on record my view that our present british government has failed lamentably to have a proper immigration policy in our country an immigration policy that tracks those coming in as well as those going out that ensures there is fairness between those who are entitled to come in and those who are not and above all a policy which will maintain good race and community relations based on the fact that the people of britain feel there is a right and proper balance between those who come in those who are here and those who go out
