madam president only last week in my constituency of northern ireland dissident republican terrorists left two viable bombs in the antrim road area of north belfast
it is really only by the grace of god that today we are not talking about multiple fatalities
hundreds of people were removed from their homes while the security forces dealt with the danger foisted upon that community
the target of this foiled attack was police officers in what is the latest in a series of attempts to murder serving officers of the police service of northern ireland
these attacks do not make the news programmes in the united kingdom let alone across europe yet they act as a reminder that while huge progress has been made in moving northern ireland forward we still have those who want to take us back
before christmas president barroso met with the northern ireland first minister peter robinson and reiterated his commitment to the barroso task force
i welcome that work and i also welcome the initial work carried out within this house in relation to peace funding
