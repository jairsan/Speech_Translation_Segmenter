mr president for strategies like youth on the move to be effective and deliver measurable results there must be increased education and business cooperation
while i agree with the rapporteur that education should not only ensure employability but also encourage creativity there is a need for a move towards integrating education and business objectives
university programmes must be brought closer to the demands of the labour market
young people should be given the opportunity to acquire without barriers the experience skills knowledge and know-how to equip themselves for future career paths and entrepreneurship
in particular it is necessary to improve opportunities for young people in vocational education and training to facilitate their mobility in the european union and allow for apprenticeships abroad thus expanding their skill set and employability
mobility programmes and the benefits of the experience of working and studying abroad must be accessible to all young people regardless of the type of education they have chosen
youth on the move has the potential to be successful but it must also translate into concrete measures that will deliver benefits for our young people
