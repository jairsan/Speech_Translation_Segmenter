mr president i do not accept the validity of this parliament or any other eu institution to make laws for the united kingdom
my electors have sent me here to tell you that they do not want gbp forty-five million of their money every single day spent in the european union
we want that money spent in the uk on our schools on our hospitals and our infrastructure not wasted on corruption with your accounts in auditing for fourteen years
simply i have this message from the people who elected me to the commission go back to your bureaucracy and prepare for the uk's withdrawal from the corrupt and doomed mess that is the european union
