madam president i refer to the third item application of european law
it could be argued that the only thing worse than clear and transparent european law is ambiguous and uncertain eu law
the commission's better regulation and simplification agenda seems to be as elusive as the holy grail
the standard of english in some proposed legislation led me at first to the conclusion that it had originated in a southern dialect of albanian
however i discovered at an early stage that most of the worst examples originated in english
the legislative process does not improve poorly drafted legislation
amendments are sent to meps at the last possible moment votes are split and then reunited we have gone into the chamber confident that we have the latest most final version of the voting list only to find that it was superseded during the morning
those meps in large groups who are content to be lobby fodder for their party leaders do not have to worry
they simply follow the gesticulations of their party tic-tac men
however for conscientious meps and those in the non-attached group it is a nightmare
