mr barroso the financial crisis in the uk is very serious
one of the many sectors struggling is the agricultural sector
from one january twenty ten things are set to get a lot worse with the introduction of eid which is electronic identification of sheep
the equipment used to scan the sheep is not accurate
i have been told it is only seventy-nine accurate
if you drive your car mr barroso down the road and the brakes only work seventy-nine of the time you will no doubt at some point crash
i fear that the agricultural sheep sector is also likely to crash with the introduction of eid with its flawed equipment
the bizarre situation is that if eid comes into force in january we will know how many sheep we have in the uk where they are and all their movements yet in the uk due to unlimited immigration we have no idea of how many people we have in our country or who they are or what movements they will make
will you mr barroso speak to the rest of the commission and only introduce eid on a voluntary basis until the equipment used is one hundred accurate
