mr president it is essential to the operation of the rule of law that institutions are subject to their own laws and rules
rule twenty-four two of the rules of procedure states quite clearly the non-attached members shall delegate one of their number to attend meetings of the conference of presidents
it does not say that the delegates shall be chosen by vote but by what other method are joint decisions to be taken
telepathic signals possibly
the administration for the non-attached has said that the delegates should be chosen by consensus
however it has not attempted to define how consensus might be established and has not attempted to arrange for a delegate to be chosen by this method
when attempts have been made to choose the delegate by election these attempts have been declared to be invalid
what has been the response of parliament to all of this
they are going to change the rules so that the delegates so-called can be chosen by the president of the parliament rather than the delegators
how long before the president of parliament excises our right to vote in the plenary session
