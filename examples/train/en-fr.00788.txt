mr president the disability convention is the first human rights convention that the european community has signed alongside its member states
this was a necessary step to allow the full implementation of the convention in the european union including in policy areas within the responsibility of the european community
as both the convention and its optional protocol came into force one year ago on three may two thousand and eight a swift conclusion by both the member states and the community is now a priority
indeed seven member states have already done so
i want to express my gratitude to parliament and in particular to the rapporteur ms jeleva for their support for the european community's conclusion of this un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities and its optional protocol
i am delighted to see that parliament can endorse both proposals
since the convention falls within the shared competence of the community and the member states and is also binding on the eu institutions i am glad to see that they are ready to work together to ensure this convention is implemented properly
the goals of the convention are very important overall to facilitate a positive impact on the lives of our fellow citizens with disabilities to improve the consistency of the legal interpretation of certain provisions within the community's competence and to ensure uniform minimum protection of the rights of persons with disabilities across the european union with regard to the obligations stemming from the convention
we need to work together to protect the human rights of persons with disabilities and an effective implementation of the un convention will do just that and meet that objective
i count on us working together towards this common goal
