mr president eu trade and economic relations with turkey are a matter of political significance too
however in spite of recognising this fact the eu finds it increasingly difficult to avoid the impression that it is playing a game of who blinks first with turkey
not willing to pay the price of interrupting the admission negotiations it expects the turks to do so exhausted by their length and complexity
the good news is that according to the latest data the turks are increasingly dissatisfied with the eu and in spite of the latter's leading position as turkey's major economic partner other partners like russia china united arab emirates the us and iran are catching up fast
therefore success in our commercial relations with turkey should not obscure the need to finally make up our minds on whether or not to accept turkey into the eu given the impact of that decision on the international position of the eu
