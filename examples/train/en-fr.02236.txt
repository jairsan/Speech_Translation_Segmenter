madam president despite increasing efforts to combat trafficking in human beings this complicated problem continues to flourish and expand across europe
this is the reason for intensified actions and adequate measures to protect individuals from the practice of trafficking for different purposes to prosecute traffickers and to provide effective remedies for victims at national and eu level
the current legal framework will effectively deal with complex transnational problems and will coordinate joint efforts at both national and eu level when addressing this profound human rights abuse and a particular form of violence against women
by means of this legal instrument we make a joint commitment to ensure that women's rights across europe are elevated to a priority level taking into consideration that this wider phenomenon indisputably has a disproportionate impact on women and girls
i would like to point out another important issue which i propose should be included in this piece of legislation
it relates to the socio-economic aspects of this widespread problem with european countries or regions where social and economic inequalities are the most important single cause of trafficking
thanks to our joint efforts we have achieved a positive outcome in the provision on the issue related to practices such as illegal adoption
in conclusion i would strongly highlight that the primary responsibility for combating trafficking rests with the member states
they should take concrete actions to prevent and suppress trafficking and to protect the human rights of trafficked persons and should play a greater role in addressing this significant problem
