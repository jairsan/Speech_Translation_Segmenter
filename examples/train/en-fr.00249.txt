mr president i suspect that this dossier will be slightly less controversial than the earlier one and certainly there is a shorter list of speakers
but we shall see
life is full of surprises
may i start by thanking the commission and indeed the council for getting us to where we are today
unlike the previous dossier this is a first reading but we provisionally have informal agreement in trialogue which will mean that there is first-reading agreement assuming colleagues support it in the vote tomorrow
colleagues may differ as to whether the trialogue text is an improvement on the original report but at least there is a trialogue agreement and history will be the best judge of that
i look forward to hearing any comments colleagues may have and i will sum up at the end
