mr president i am so pleased that the report on the city guide and business directories has received enormous support and i congratulate the rapporteur on the work
this is an issue which arose from the ground and which parliament has responded to
it involves individuals clubs schools and businesses being ripped off by companies which thrive on a lack of coordination
i hope that the vote today will bring the message that people should be very careful about signing and that parliament is listening to their concerns and that we will be demanding that action be taken in member states and at european level which stops the practice of extracting money from businesses under false pretences
this is a very good day for simon busuttil the rapporteur and a very good day too for the committee on petitions which has pushed this issue at every step
i look forward to reporting back to my constituents the hundreds of them who have contacted me about this and reporting on real progress here
