madam president let me first congratulate marisa and my colleagues for reaching an agreement with the council on such a complex dossier
the text now on the table reinforces the security of our legal chain of supply for medicinal products but let me emphasise that only one of falsified medicines reach our patients via this legal chain
the other ninety-nine comes from illegal channels and the black market
in this regard i very much welcome the additional provisions focusing on the internet put forward by the european parliament
but in order to address this major risk for patients <unk> we must also reinforce eu actions in the field of justice police and customs cooperation
the commission should go further in this field and we insist on this to combat falsified medicines properly
regarding the specific provisions of the agreement to be voted on tomorrow and most particularly the new safety features to be implemented i would like to ask the commission to clearly monitor the impact of this directive
in its initial report the committee on the environment stated that the measures put in place should respond to three guiding principles proportionality cost-effectiveness and independence
