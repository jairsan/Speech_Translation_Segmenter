mr president as is so common here this debate has little connection to reality and none whatsoever to democracy
most here talk as though iceland being sucked into the euro black hole is a done deal
but that is not the message coming from icelanders
current opinion polls show that those who wish to keep their independence outnumber the euro-quislings and europhiles nearly two to one
seventy-five percent of icelanders wisely do not trust the eu
the only icelandic party in favour of membership has slumped from thirty to eighteen in the polls
it is the same all over europe
while the political elite move to ever closer union and federal empire the people want freedom and independence
such mismatches are the seedbed of revolution
congratulate yourselves on accession progress all you like but the coming financial meltdown in the countries being crushed in your euro straightjacket will be costly to us all but fatal to your utopia
iceland and the nations now stuck in your raspberry reich will be free at last
