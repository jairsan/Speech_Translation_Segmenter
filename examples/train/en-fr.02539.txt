mr higgins i was actually about to make a statement before i gave the floor to the commissioner for what will be the last question because believe you me i am as angry as you
i do not like sitting here in these circumstances having to disappoint a large number of members and having to keep a number of members of the commission waiting
the people i would like you to target are your group leaders and i say that again loud and clear it is the group leaders who set the agenda and leave us in a situation almost every plenary week where we do no have enough time to deal properly with question time to the commission or indeed when it has taken place to the council
it is unsatisfactory i have made my views known before
i would ask each and every member who cares about it to contact their group leaders and tell them what they think because i am stuck with the agenda as i find it when i take over the chair and i do not enjoy it
