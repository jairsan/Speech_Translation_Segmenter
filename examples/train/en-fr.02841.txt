mr president i congratulate richard falbr on the comprehensive approach to international labour standards in his report
i have been pleased to contribute to his work on the specific question of corporate social responsibility
tonight this gives us a chance to influence the commission in advance of its csr communication by asking it firstly to maintain the open definition of csr latterly adopted by it in the multi-stakeholder forum to return to the principle of convergence in private and voluntary csr initiatives which was its former policy to make concrete proposals for implementing global csr standards specifically the updated oecd guidelines on multinational enterprises and the new ruggie framework on business and human rights to commit to the principle of integrated financial environmental social and human rights reporting by business indeed paving the way towards the possibility of future legislation in this area and to advance the responsibility of european businesses in their global supply chain responding to the governance gaps identified in the commission's own recent edinburgh study
parliament always likes to help the commission ms reding
i hope these suggestions help tonight
