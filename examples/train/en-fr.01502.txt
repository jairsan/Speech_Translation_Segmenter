mr president i am very pleased that my first attendance at the plenary session of the european parliament takes place on this important day eight march international women's day
it is also an honour for me to represent the commission and in particular vice-president reding who will lead the commission's efforts to protect fundamental rights
this is a unique opportunity to collectively celebrate the economic political and social achievements of women past present and future
in nineteen fifty-seven gender equality was enshrined in the european treaties
since then an impressive number of legal instruments followed by a great number of decisions by the european court of justice have created a legal arsenal at eu level
i would like to remind you that gender equality is not only a fundamental value enshrined in the treaty but also that gender equality policies have proven to be a driver for economic growth
last friday the president of the european commission and vice-president reding renewed the commission's commitment to the values of gender equality by presenting a women's charter
the women's charter represents the political commitment of the commission to advance equality between women and men in five areas equal economic independence equal pay for equal work and work of equal value equality in decision making dignity integrity and an end to gender-based violence and gender equality beyond the union
the women's charter will be followed in september twenty ten by a new comprehensive strategy for equality between women and men
this strategy will translate the principles of the women's charter into concrete actions to be implemented in the next five years
these are ambitious projects and objectives that the commission will not be able to achieve alone
it will need to work in close cooperation with its main partners at eu level and in particular with you the european parliament and the femm committee
international women's day is an excellent opportunity to remind us all of this commitment
