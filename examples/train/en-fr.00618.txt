mr president i voted for this reluctantly not because of the nonsense that has just come from the other side of the house but because i share the concerns of the rapporteur mr hegyi
this report has been really watered down by those in this house who do not want to have active dialogue with the citizens of europe
for me active dialogue does not mean glossy brochures and i do believe that the commission has failed in this area
it has failed to actively engage and connect with the citizens
it has failed to get across a greater understanding of how the work that is being done at eu level is addressing many of the real issues that affect citizens everyday lives
i hope that as a result of this report it will revisit it and come up with some more imaginative ways of addressing this issue
