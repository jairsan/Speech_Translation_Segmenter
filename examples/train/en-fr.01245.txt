mr president i want to make it clear that while i feel that helping small business is a very good idea and one that should be pursued it should be pursued at national government level
i have huge concerns over this proposal about the accountability of the money that will be lent and the payback in relation it
i would encourage national governments to do all they can to help small business which is the backbone of our economy
the eu can help by decreasing regulation and making funds available at a national level
