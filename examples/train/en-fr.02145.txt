in relation to border controls customs controls must balance the protection of a range of eu financial safety and security interests with the interests of legitimate traders
for this reason a community risk management framework was developed enabling customs controls for security and safety to be carried out on the basis of common risk criteria and standards
in the eu one point five million tonnes of sea cargo and twelve million tonnes of air cargo are checked each year
under article two hundred and nine one of the treaty on the functioning of the european union the member states customs services are responsible for the application of the eu legislation concerned
therefore they are in charge of organising customs controls at physical frontiers and elsewhere on the basis of risk management techniques as specified in the eu's customs code
with regard to cigarette smuggling the commission plays an active role in helping member states to tackle the phenomenon of international cigarette smuggling and to dismantle the criminal gangs responsible for this trade
in particular the european anti-fraud office assists law enforcement authorities throughout the european union with their operational cases and coordinates major customs and criminal investigations with the member states and third countries
using the provisions of european mutual assistance in customs matters and a number of agreements concluded between the eu and third countries olaf organises joint customs operations between eu member states and with third countries aimed at targeting specific problems such as operation matthew ii targeting road traffic on the eastern border or operation sirocco focused on deep-sea container transports from china to the union
finally olaf provides financial support to member states from the hercule ii programme for measures specifically targeting cigarette smuggling such as the purchase of specialist x-ray scanning equipment to be used at border points and the organisation of regional actions
moreover cooperation agreements were signed with british american tobacco and imperial tobacco limited in twenty ten and agreements were signed with philip morris international and japan tobacco international in two thousand and four and two thousand and seven respectively
these legally binding agreements provide a comprehensive set of measures designed to limit the presence of the products of these companies on the illicit tobacco market
