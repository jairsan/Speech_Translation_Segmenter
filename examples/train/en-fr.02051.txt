madam president this drama reminds us of our responsibility as politicians
it is not an urgent matter to come up with another new law another legislative package
we already have a full environmental in the european mining waste directive
the problem in europe is not about having a proper legislative framework but about the proper implementation of these laws by the member states
obviously companies have had way too much leverage in negotiating with national authorities over what constitutes hazardous waste that should fall under the strictest safety standards
furthermore i am honestly worried when i hear of the large number of toxic deposits all across the danube region and of over one zero contaminated sites in romania alone
i think the first priority in terms of prevention should be to list these sites in europe
we cannot afford to wait until twenty twelve for this to come into force
member states should voluntarily share this information with the commission as quickly as possible
this case also demonstrates that the commission should be given more means to ensure correct implementation of environmental law especially in central and eastern europe
it also shows that the commission should also be given more resources to investigate quality control and inspection of these dangerous sites
last but not least i should like to emphasise that the basic principle should be that polluters pay for the environmental damage they cause
this is why i am unsure that the use of the eu solidarity fund for natural disasters would be appropriate as it may undermine this principle at the core of the environmental liability directive
