madam president i voted for this report like many others who are actively engaged with farmers in their region
one of the key things we hear about all the time is the bureaucracy involved in the industry
so a key aspect of the new cap must be a reduction in the amount of red tape and bureaucracy
legislation must be meaningful to farmers and we must not restrict farmers from food production
however not only streamlining of legislation is important but also flexibility for member states and most importantly with the commission and the european court of auditors
the european court of auditors has shown little to no flexibility or indeed common sense when applying penalties
this legislation needs urgent attention and more common sense is needed
a financial review is also needed to assess the cost of farm inspections and the amount of money recovered in penalties to see if this is actually value for money for the taxpayer
