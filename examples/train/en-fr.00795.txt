following the bse crisis in the beef sector some years back we brought in full identification and traceability for beef products in europe
would the council not agree that we need to move swiftly not just on poultry but sheep and pigmeat as well to give consumers the same information and indeed to provide the same traceability if something should go wrong
the sommer report on information to consumers is wending its way through parliament at the moment and perhaps through added labelling which would add to the traceability the council might agree with me that this would be a way of achieving this
