mr president i was a member of the european parliament delegation that travelled to gaza last week to see the devastation and the focus of parliament's resolution today is humanitarian action which is desperately needed
this is a real humanitarian crisis and how are we going to address that urgently
ninety per cent of people in gaza are dependent on un aid
this is not linked to any negotiations
we have to ensure that that aid gets through and the key to that is the lifting of the siege and the opening of the crossing points
how can a densely populated area of one point five million people that has been bombed for twenty-two days and in which over one zero people were killed even begin to recover when only fifteen categories of humanitarian items are being allowed in food some medicines and mattresses
you cannot rebuild homes and offices without cement and glass which are banned
you cannot teach children in schools that have no paper because it is banned
you cannot feed people when there is not enough food being allowed in
it is not that the aid is not there but it is not being allowed through
we have to put pressure on the israeli government to end the blockade and open the crossings
any assessment of the damage caused in gaza must draw attention to the deliberate targeting to destroy the infrastructure and the economy
we saw schools factories homes and a hospital deliberately attacked
once again we have witnessed the destruction by israel of projects funded by the european union and rather than take action on this we are talking about upgrading trade relations when conditions on human rights are currently being breached under the current agreements
mr solana talked about how pursuing the same policies can bring us back to the same place
well i agree
in two thousand and six the european union refused to recognise the palestinian unity government which included members of hamas and yet we are ready to recognise a new israeli government which may include members who reject a two-state solution who do not support a palestinian state
what is crucial now is that the eu must be prepared to work with and recognise an interim palestinian national government of consensus that should emerge from the cairo talks in the next few weeks and we must give out clear signals of our intentions to the international community
we have to support the reconciliation process in palestine as part of achieving a long-term solution and that means ensuring that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past
