mr president the european union's greatest achievement is the establishment of the single market
the free movement of goods services labour and capital drives innovation and increases the prosperity of the five hundred million people who live in europe
the common market was the reason my country joined the eec and the single market is the reason we remain part of the eu but in recent years the eu's focus has strayed from completing the single market
too much time and money has been wasted on grandiose projects that do not benefit the people we represent
i believe it is time to refocus our attention on the single market
its expansion and success is crucial for our economies
it is one of the few areas where the eu can deliver growth rather than impede it
i would ask the commissioner to be bold
rather than creating more regulations that drive jobs away from the city of london i would ask him to focus on creating a competitive and job-creating single market for europe
