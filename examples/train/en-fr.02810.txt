mr president once again i deplore the persisting climate of fear and intimidation towards political opponents in belarus and the ongoing harassment and persecution of opposition figures since the presidential elections in december twenty ten
secondly i strongly condemn all convictions resulting from the criminal charges of mass rioting and find them politically motivated and of a questionable nature
i would like to stress that the trials were held behind closed doors
detainees were refused the opportunity to call their witnesses and to meet in proper conditions and on a regular basis with their legal representatives
the lawyers of the accused received several warnings from the ministry of justice and some of them have been disbarred
i consider that this conduct of the trials lacked impartiality
finally i condemn the lack of respect for the fundamental rights of freedom of assembly and of expression shown by the belarusian authorities and call for the immediate and unconditional release of the remaining protestors still in custody and for all charges against them to be dropped
