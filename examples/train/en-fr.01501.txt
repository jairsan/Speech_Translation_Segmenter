mr president on this day i wish to ask all politicians and legislators to stop issuing all these demagogic laws on equality that make life more difficult for women who wish to work
they are scaring organisations away from employing women
equality is not about laws it is about behaviour
as a working mother in all my thirty years of professional life i have never been recruited or promoted on anything other than my qualifications and merit and i would be insulted if somebody gave me special treatment merely due to my chromosomes
however i do have specific requests for this parliament to defend the women of this world
i want the spanish land-grab problem to be debated and resolved to end the suffering of many women and men who risk demolition of their houses and cannot live in them
do you not think this is violence
i want this parliament to stop the flow of eu funds to the regions where this enormous breach of human rights is taking place
do you not think this is violence
i want this parliament to hear and protect those who want to communicate their concerns on structural irregularities affecting the european budget as i did eight years ago and ensure they do not suffer my fate
is this not violence
i want you to withhold discharge to the european commission until the auditors clear one hundred of the budget without reservations
this is how i wish this parliament to honour the women and the men of europe those who with their taxes allow this european union to exist
