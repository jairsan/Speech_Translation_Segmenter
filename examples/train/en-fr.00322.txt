madam president this goes to the core of this whole european union
here we are approving more money to try and persuade the public to vote for the wretched lisbon treaty
the public on being given a chance in the republic of ireland made it absolutely clear that they do not want it and if the people of britain were to be given a chance and they should have been because they were promised it in the last general election by the labour government they would also vote overwhelmingly to reject this treaty
the message should be heard loud and clear in the european union it really should people do not want it
people do not want more control in brussels and strasbourg
people want their own governments and their own legislatures to be making the decisions that affect them
until that message is received we will keep pumping more taxpayers money into forcing people to the polling box in the pretence that you actually persuade them to change their minds
they will not do so
