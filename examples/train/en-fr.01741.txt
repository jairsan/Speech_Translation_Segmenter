commissioner does not the original question demonstrate the scale of the problem you face when addressing this issue
many members here and many governments represented in the council just do not accept the need for urgent action to prevent climate change
it is easy for them to sign up to pious resolutions at a time of economic prosperity but now that is not the case they are reluctant to sign up to practical action
do you not need to address the problem of climate change denial if you are to raise our ambitions
