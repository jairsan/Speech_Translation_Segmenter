madam president i am not of course in favour of the european union assuming the right to conclude treaties at all
however i will endeavour to look objectively at the principles governing treaties about pnr
the approach taken to weigh the two sometimes contradictory needs of privacy and security is essentially sound
people have a right to keep details of their lives confidential but authorities have not only a right but a duty to safeguard the lives of their peoples
if only terrorists and serious criminals wore black hats and displayed sinister sneers those two needs could be satisfied simultaneously
however the union does allow its own ideological inhibitions to get in the way of achieving the right balance
i can understand its reluctance to reveal unnecessarily information about people's origins or opinions
where this has no connection or even correlation with terrorism that inhibition is a healthy one
however in an era in which a particular section of the population is disproportionately involved in terrorism and that section might change i see no objection against profiling of that population
