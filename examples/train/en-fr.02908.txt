madam president like other colleagues i believe that safety must come first
however i also believe that nuclear power should be part of our future energy mix
it is low carbon and it can provide a secure supply
for example it will mean that prosperous european countries will not have to import energy from less prosperous countries with all the problems that that can bring
it is also supported by communities like anglesey in north wales who already have a nuclear power station
however like all other colleagues i also support stress tests as does the uk and i think all member states should give their commitment to those stress tests
they should also be done quickly they should cover all eventualities and they should cover both nuclear plants and other facilities within the fuel cycle
this is such an important issue for us all
i believe europe needs nuclear power but it needs safe nuclear power
