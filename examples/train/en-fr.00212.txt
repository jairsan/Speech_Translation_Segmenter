mr president aisha ibrahim duhulow was barely a teenager
she would probably have never known anything about the european union or its parliament
even as she was being gang-raped or lay dying under a deluge of stones she would probably never have imagined that politicians far away would recognise her ordeal and commemorate her very short life
but i am sure that as she died she knew that she was the victim of a grave injustice
the sickening crimes she suffered are made all the more shocking by the bizarre details of this case the crowd of one thousand people the venue of a stadium as though it was some kind of spectator sport the truckload of stones ordered specially for the purpose the gunmen who fired at people trying to their credit to save this poor girl's life
somalia is a failed state and there is little the eu can do practically to address the barbarity of the various clans and islamist militias in charge of areas outside the government's control
where we can take a stand however is by asserting our own values which are incompatible with sharia law
that is not just my opinion but also the opinion of the european court of human rights
this tragic case merely reinforces our determination never to surrender our hard-won democratic freedoms to obscurantism
