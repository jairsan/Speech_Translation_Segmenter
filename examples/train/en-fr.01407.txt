mr president i want to raise an issue here that i have been raising in my own country in the hope that by raising it from the top down and the bottom up we might somehow get some action on it
we are constantly talking about the banking crisis and what we can do for small and medium-sized enterprises
the problem is that there are many small and medium-sized enterprises that simply cannot get loans even though they have viable businesses and can give employment
the biggest reason for that in my experience is the absence of bank managers
we got into this crisis because the banking system was on automatic and in many cases it is still on automatic
the european central bank and the european commission have given a lot of support to the financial institutions
it is time now that we returned and used every influence we have to return to the traditional bank manager who can make calculated risk based on character ability and track record
i really think that would make a difference and i say this to the twenty-seven commissioners here present do not underestimate your ability to influence
