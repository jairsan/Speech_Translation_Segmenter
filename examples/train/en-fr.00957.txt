this is a very timely question and i could answer very briefly that the priorities are agreement in copenhagen for reduction commitments by developed countries nationally appropriate mitigation actions by developing countries and finance
i would however like to say a few more words
we now have less than three months until copenhagen and the climate talks have now entered into a crucial phase
with two hundred and fifty pages of negotiating text on the table the negotiations have not yet gathered sufficient momentum to come to an agreement that is ambitious and detailed enough
however among most parties there is a sense of urgency and the willingness to focus on areas of convergence
the ultimate objective of the climate agreement is to keep global warming below two degrees celsius an objective that was endorsed at the last g eight summit and the major economies forum
we need comparable and more ambitious emission reduction targets for the group of developed countries which in aggregate today offer less than fifteen reduction as compared with nineteen ninety
this falls short of the twenty-five forty reduction required by science
we welcome the fact that japan will strengthen its target
the eu has offered to take up a thirty reduction target if others make comparable commitments
developing countries should take appropriate mitigation actions to curb the growth of their emissions to fifteen thirty below business as usual by twenty twenty
the eu proposes that developing countries except least developed countries design and implement low carbon growth plans containing their key mitigation actions
these plans would then form the basis for targeted financial and other support
adequate international financing will be essential to reach an effective agreement in copenhagen
money will make or break the deal
we need to mobilise private investment and promote the establishment of a robust international carbon market but substantial public funding will also be required
in this respect it is worth mentioning the global partnership on technology which aims at doubling investment in low carbon technologies
furthermore we have to strengthen support to the poorest and most vulnerable countries to adapt to the increasing adverse effects of climate change
last week on ten september two thousand and nine the commission adopted a communication on stepping up international climate finance which aims at speeding up the international negotiations
there is a daunting task ahead of us with intense negotiations over the coming months but failure is not an option
