the commission is closely monitoring the developments regarding smart phones and related markets
as the honourable member recognises in his question in some instances new markets are being created
the commission is fully committed to ensuring that general eu rules and principles relating to competition are respected while taking account of the dynamic and fast-changing circumstances in the market
as recent cases such as microsoft and intel have shown the commission will take enforcement action to ensure that competition on the merits allows where necessary consumers to choose between different alternatives and therefore benefit from technical developments and innovations
in that respect while acknowledging that proprietary technology is at the heart of europe's success in second- and third-generation mobile technologies the commission is at the same time aware of the excellent technical development driven by non-profit technologies
while we have to leave it up to the industry to decide the specific business model it wants to use and up to the market to choose the winner the commission emphasises the importance of interoperability in encouraging competition on the merits between technologies from different companies and helping prevent lock-in
in this context the commission welcomes the use of openness specifications that may prevent the unfair transmission of dominant positions between neighbouring markets
open platforms serve that purpose allowing the creation of competitive markets on top of software systems
