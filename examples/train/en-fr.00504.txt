madam president in the current difficult economic climate this report brings the kind of joined-up thinking that is desperately needed
vat reductions will help most the people who need it most the people who earn less than others
i believe this report is also about job creation and that is why i supported it
it is about making sure that jobs do not disappear into the black economy
i hope that it will be implemented quickly especially in my region in the west midlands
we also need to stress that we have to allow member states to reduce vat on certain items to battle against climate change
providing people with an incentive to buy green is exactly the kind of market-based instrument that will reap the greatest benefits
vat reductions across the world are used to encourage people to buy energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly fridges freezers and other goods that use up large amounts of energy and cheaper prices for these products will help the less well-off
my government in the uk has taken the lead on this issue by reducing vat by two point five until twenty ten and i hope other member states will also follow suit
