i agree entirely with that
i think the european parliament's behaviour on this particularly latterly has been a good democratic example for everybody
my supplementary deals with the question of sharing the burden on counter-terrorism between the united states and the european union
does the president believe that the agreements which we have been discussing place too much of a burden on the united states as opposed to allowing us to adopt the burden or be subject to the burden of sharing responsibilities and resources in respect of counter-terrorism
