mr president i am really pleased that the gaps in the nineteen ninety-four timeshare directive are finally being addressed by this parliament so that consumers can look forward to better protection for their investments
it will also in the long run protect up to forty zero european jobs
i have taken a particular interest in this report as it covers an issue that directly affects many of my constituents
we have more timeshare owners in the uk than any other european country
therefore this will reassure many of them that europe is acting to protect them from scam traders
the uk timeshare industry is worth approximately eur one hundred and fifty-seven million per year and this directive constitutes an important move forward in eliminating unscrupulous agents who cause problems for consumers and bring legitimate operators into disrepute
these new simplified rules will ensure that consumers are equally well protected across the eu while creating a level playing field in the market for timeshare and other popular holiday-related products
