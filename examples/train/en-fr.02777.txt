mr president i am a baby boomer
i was born just after the war
from that time we have probably had the longest period of peace and prosperity globally
i have put a little bit of modest money away so that i can hand something down to my family when i pass on largely because i have never spent more money than i have earned
i have been prudent and i have worked moderately hard
it always seems to me to come as a complete surprise to politicians how countries get in debt
let me explain because i do not think you really understand
it is because politicians consistently spend more money than they raise in taxation more money than they can possibly raise in taxation most of which in point of fact they actually waste
the reason we are talking about countries which are broke and they are broke is because their ridiculous ineffective ignorant politicians consistently spend more money than they can raise
then they borrow and they borrow and worse they then print money because politicians and their central banks have a machine which prints money
if you do that as a private citizen it is a criminal offence
you would go to prison for that yet politicians and their central banks do it all the time
let me explain to you that these countries are broke
they are broke because of their own stupid leadership and politicians
it is immoral immoral to ask ordinary taxpayers of any country to pick up the tab for failed politicians and failed banks
they have defaulted
they are broke
for god's sake let us all admit it
