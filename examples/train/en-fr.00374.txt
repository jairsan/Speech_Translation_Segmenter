mr president is it ethically acceptable and is it excusable in international law that in its endeavour to neutralise hamas terrorists the state of israel can embark on a major military campaign of terror and gross violation of un conventions and human rights against one point five million trapped innocent civilians
is such action consistent with our own eu values of justice and democracy
is the israeli lobby so strong that it can cause the us and the eu to in effect stand idle and just watch unspeakable atrocities being committed in the name of the fight against terror
if the answer to these questions is yes then we should all commend as brave the israeli government for their action in gaza
if the answer is no then we should strongly and clearly condemn israel and must take swift and effective steps against it including trade sanctions in order to end the carnage in gaza today and in the future
i disagree strongly with the minister who left who said that we can in effect do very little
we can do a lot and we must
