madam president illegal immigration is a problem which is made worse by the free movement of peoples
however the current wave of unrest that is spreading rapidly through britain is of course being caused by legal migration and by the european union's own rules
for twenty years british trade unions having being seduced by jacques delors thought the european union was in their interests
well now the penny has dropped and they have realised that a british government is unable to put british interests first
i am afraid it will get quite a lot worse
as we embark upon a round of massive public spending projects such as the olympics and council house building thousands of european workers are set to benefit
british jobs for british workers cannot be guaranteed all the while we are inside the eu
the prospect of british taxpayers funding foreign workers is frankly unacceptable
but the government is holding firm saying that the european union is a wonderful thing
well it is not surprising is it
lord mandelson is still getting gbp seventy-eight zero a year from the european commission and of course gets a dependent pension on this in just a few years time a conflict of interest if ever i saw one
the big concern now is whether the xenophobic far right will benefit
we do not want that either
we in ukip will put a non-racist agenda to the british people at the european elections saying that it is time to put british interests first
we are not protectionists but we want good common sense
we want to control our own borders and decide who lives works and settles in our country
