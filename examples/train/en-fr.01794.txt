mr president i will leave aside the most pertinent question this morning and that is how on earth are european taxpayers going to pay for all of the apparatus and secretariat that has been talked about and proposed in this house this morning
i want to give my view that there is no doubt that stability in the mediterranean is certainly good for the wider european union
however with european union help comes responsibility from the very countries that want to benefit from the institutions and the enhanced economic opportunities
i want to focus very quickly on one aspect and that is the rejection of a thousand tonnes of seed potatoes from northern ireland by the moroccan authorities this year a trade that had been going on for over twenty years potatoes that had been inspected according to the normal rules before they left my country and then were rejected by the moroccan authorities under a different regime
i do understand and i respect that commissioner de gucht is looking into this matter but i want to stress that we do need responsibility from those who hope to benefit
