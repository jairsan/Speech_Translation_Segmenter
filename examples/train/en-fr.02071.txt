madam president i just want to respond to some of the comments which have been made
what pakistan is trying to do at this point is actually to help itself out of the mess that it is in after the devastating floods
if the factories were in flood-hit areas they would not be able to produce so it is not surprising that the factories concerned are not in flood-hit areas
the direct aid that could be put in is miniscule compared to what the need actually is
distribution of the income from the additional exports is important we know that for infrastructure for energy supplies for schools for roads etc
while there are indeed responsibilities that lie with the democratically elected government of pakistan in terms of its effectiveness of income of tax revenue and so on
people have also talked about the need for greater diversity
if pakistan had a greater diversity of industrial sectors we would not be concentrating so much on textiles
i appeal to members to offer that country this opportunity to help itself out of this disaster
