mr president i want to express my support for the impressive way in which the czech presidency has dealt with some of the crucial issues facing europe
from the economic and financial crisis to energy security and climate change the presidency has been steadfast and clear in its objectives and it has offered europe clear leadership in testing times
in particular prime minister topolánek has demonstrated clear leadership above all in warning of the dangers of protectionism
when others flirted with erecting damaging barriers to trade the czech presidency has spoken clearly and consistently for open trade and crucially for the vital need to uphold the single market
earlier this month mr topolánek said that protectionism is always harmful and in the case of the eu it is illogical
we must learn a lesson from the crisis and say no to isolation no to protectionism and yes to cooperation
he was so right to remind us all of the fundamental principle that underlines the eu
this honesty stands in marked contrast to the disingenuous and self-serving speech delivered by the british prime minister in this chamber yesterday
mr brown's speech was long on hyperbole but singularly failed to mention the central fact that the united kingdom will under his leadership have the longest and deepest recession of any industrialised nation
he ignored his role in putting in place and operating a fundamentally flawed financial regulatory framework
he ignored the enormous debt burden he has placed on the british people
europe needs no lectures from the british government about what must be done to get out of this crisis
europe and the international community now need to move quickly to restore confidence in our financial systems to ensure a properly functioning banking system in which individuals mr schulz and businesses can place their trust and get banks lending again to boost confidence
we must hold firm to the principles of free trade and the single market and i have every confidence that the presidency will continue to work hard to achieve these vital goals
