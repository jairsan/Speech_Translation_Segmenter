mr president i also voted in favour of this resolution because i think we should once again reiterate our support for the european integration aspirations of the countries in the balkan region within the stabilisation and association process
albania is certainly a country which has made tangible progress in the context of the reform process
however it is also a country which needs to do more to get closer to eu norms and accession criteria
more substantial efforts are needed to consolidate democracy and the rule of law and to ensure the country's sustainable development
the political crisis following the june two thousand and nine parliamentary elections is deplorable
we must make clear to our albanian partners that fully functioning representative institutions parliament being the most important one are the backbone of a consolidated democratic system and perhaps the most important political criterion for eu integration
