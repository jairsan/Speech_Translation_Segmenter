mr president on two october the irish will have a referendum on the lisbon treaty
the lisbon treaty is almost identical to the european constitution which was rejected outright by the french and the dutch
the lisbon treaty has already been rejected by the irish once but no is always the wrong answer as far as the european union is concerned when it comes to further political integration
and so the irish are forced to have yet another referendum so they can deliver the only answer that is acceptable to the european union which is yes
the european union is destroying democracy in its member states
the eu is founded on misrepresentation deceit and lies
the british are denied a referendum by our contemptible government and political class precisely because they know that the result would be a resounding no
but whatever the result in ireland britain will one day leave the european union and restore its national independence
i am proud to use my position of office to campaign for britain's unconditional withdrawal from the european union
