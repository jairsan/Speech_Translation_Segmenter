mr president i would like to congratulate mrs beer on an excellent and timely report
this is the year of all nuclear debates
the us is preparing its nuclear posture review nato is reviewing its strategic concept and the world is getting ready for the twenty ten npt review conference
all of this is happening in a special context
the us is once again being led by a president barack obama who espouses the vision of a world without nuclear weapons
this is not the time for timidity or hesitation
our voters would not understand if this parliament prepared a report on the npt which was less ambitious than that of the current us administration
of course us leadership on this issue is welcome
after all the us and russia are the undisputed global nuclear hegemons
however europe cannot sit passively by while moscow and washington discuss its strategic future
we need to present our own npt narrative based on a strict balance between the non-proliferation and disarmament agendas
this is what this report is all about and this is the spirit of the socialist plenary amendments
why not support the model nuclear weapons convention and the hiroshima-nagasaki protocol both of which are promoted globally by civil organisations and political leaders
it is our role as parliamentarians unencumbered by the weight and limitations of executive power to show our governments and therefore the council the way in this field
i hope the house can support the pse amendments
