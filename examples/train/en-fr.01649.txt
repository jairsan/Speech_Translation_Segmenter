first of all can i apologise to the commissioner
we are all suffering a little bit of cabin fever because some of us have not been able to get home and are trying to help some of our families to move around the place
i realise that the commissioner has other appointments and is substituting for a colleague
could i ask the commissioner in relation to his reply what would constitute the medium term
are we talking half-way through the lifetime of this commission
are we talking a year eighteen months
what sort of period does he see for some more definitive response in this issue to materialise
