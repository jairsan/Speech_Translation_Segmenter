mr president the discussion on the european external action service is taking place at a time when the need for a long-term eu strategy on how to work with the other parts of the globe in the dramatically changing world has become urgent
we need bold strategies vision and actions as the emerging global powers are modernising more quickly than europe ever did and are becoming more and more assertive
our geopolitical strategic thinking in foreign policy cannot be limited to climate change and energy security
one of the three institutions that will in practice be active in foreign policy president of the council president of the commission and high representative must have the geopolitical strategic competences assigned to it and not only short-term fixing of emerging problems which leads to lowest common denominator-based foreign policy
in my view the natural candidate for these strategic competences is the high representative drawing on the competences and expertise of the european external action service
