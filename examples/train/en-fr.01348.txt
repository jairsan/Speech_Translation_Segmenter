the outcome of copenhagen was deeply disappointing but we must now move forward
the eu needs to commit itself now to a thirty cut in emissions for three reasons
the first is simply that a thirty cut requires barely more effort now than the original twenty cut simply because of the fall in economic activity due to the recession
secondly to rein back now would be to lose the momentum which has been built up in the new green industries
we cannot half-commit to investment in renewable energy sources and low-carbon transport
there is massive infrastructure which needs to be put in place whether it is a north sea supergrid or on a smaller scale plug-in charging points for electric cars
hundreds and thousands of new jobs are at stake potentially seventy zero jobs relating to offshore wind in the uk alone but these jobs which are so necessary for economic recovery will only be realised if there is a clear roadmap towards a zero-carbon europe by twenty fifty
investment has to have certainty and we need to be aware that europe is in danger of losing its place as leader on renewable technology
both the us and china are growing their renewables industries very rapidly
if we hesitate now those new green jobs will move to other continents
finally we need that thirty cut because most of the extra commitment can easily be realised by increased energy efficiency
not to do more on energy efficiency would in any case be crazy
energy efficiency means economic efficiency
it means lower energy bills not higher ones and it improves energy security
so whatever figures are put on the table by the other parties on thirty-one january and maybe we will be pleasantly surprised the eu must commit now to a thirty cut
