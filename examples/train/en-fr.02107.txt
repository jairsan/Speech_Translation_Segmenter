mr president the commissioner said he was willing to look at market supports where necessary and will intervene when necessary but we need some kind of certainty for livestock farmers
they are being attacked on all sides there is a huge increase in prices partly due to speculation
i am very pleased to see that we carried the amendment which asks the commission to deal immediately with the issue of adventitious presence of gmos in imported feeds
that is something we have control over and we should deal with it and we have been sitting on our hands and refusing to deal with it
we also heard about the high cost of compliance with eu regulations so that we do not have a level playing field for third country imports
but perhaps one of the most crucial issues is the whole area of the food chain
yesterday the court of auditors issued a report on the sugar sector and one of their recommendations was that price formation be subject to regular monitoring by the commission and that the commission and the member states ensure that competition law is correctly enforced in the sector thus ensuring the treaty objective that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices
it is not only in the sugar sector that we need to do that
we need to do it in the whole food chain
