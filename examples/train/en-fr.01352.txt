madam president can i say to the minister that it is my experience that some banks by no means all banks but some banks perhaps even a lot of banks behaved irresponsibly during the financial market growth and some banks perhaps again not all banks but many banks are continuing to behave irresponsibly in the time of the budding weeks and months of recovery
i am aware for example of one particular company in dublin very well run where the man is meticulous in meeting his commitments and the bank is far from helping him
it has taken the opportunity to reduce his overdraft and put him under pressure in his business a business that is viable a business that will survive this recession
please minister take these banks in hand tell them we are giving them taxpayers money and we expect them to take the public interest into account not just the interests of their shareholders some of them very wealthy shareholders
