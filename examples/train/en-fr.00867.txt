madam president i do not really think i need to add anything except that monica frassoni's justification about particular amendments might be a reason for her to vote against those amendments
they are certainly not a reason to refer the whole thing back to committee which would preclude the adoption of any of the amendments that have been tabled today and which would be most unfortunate
