madam president i would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have worked with me
i have been mrs vis for over four years and together with the shadows we have formed quite a close club and i will miss you all
i will particularly miss you if i may say so madam president as we may not see each other after june
we have been an all-female club which has been delightful but i would also like to thank all the staff involved who have not all been female
they have been excellent
i respect the positions of ms kaufmann and ms Å¾danoka
i understand their positions and i thank them very much for taking a full part in the negotiations and in the discussions even though as they pointed out they cannot support the outcome
i am very sad that mr coelho is not able to support this compromise
i hope he understands how hard i fought for some of the elements that he also wanted
after all they were in my original report
if he thinks i could have achieved more that might cause some spluttering in the council and commission because i think they saw me as quite a tough customer to deal with
mr batten has left the chamber
i think that was part of the ukip election campaign
as mrs <unk> pointed out the uk is not party to the visa information system as the country is not in schengen so the uk has full control of its own borders
i think mr batten as usual was somewhat muddled in his thinking
i thank all the other speakers who made constructive contributions
i am glad that we are putting this to bed as i personally feel that i wish to resign from being mrs vis after this
