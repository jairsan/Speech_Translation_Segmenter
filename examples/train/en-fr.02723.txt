mr president the rise in fuel prices has created yet another problem for fishermen but it is only the latest problem not the first
for the british fishing fleet the biggest problem is membership of the eu
the uk provides the eu with seventy of its fishing but is allowed only thirteen of its quotas
would it not be fair for the uk to receive a more proportionate share
in particular the weight of cod landed in britain has fallen from three hundred zero tonnes before joining what was then the eec to just seven zero tonnes today
british fishermen are facing further losses in the number of days at sea and are slowly being driven out of business
in the long term british fishermen want withdrawal from the eu in the short term they demand fair treatment under the common fisheries policy
british fishermen as representatives of the host country must have an increase in the number of days at sea
we have heard of unsustainable fishing but british waters are not being overfished by british fleets the problem is that british waters have been thrown open to all
