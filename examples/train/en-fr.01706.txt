mr president lest i forget i do have a visitors group in the gallery and i would like to welcome them from the ireland-east constituency
i think it is very important that our visitors and citizens see how this parliament works and as you can see they are awake and interested this morning on this particular report the le foll report this chamber hosted one of the beatles recently telling us that we should eat less meat
well i think that what we need to do in relation to agriculture and climate change is to use the best available technologies to reduce the emissions which come from agriculture because we all know that we need to produce more food globally rather than less
we will need to do that with fewer resources less soil less water and with the pressures of climate change and what we need is the best possible research i believe it needs to be publicly funded and with private partnerships so that our farmers and food industry can produce food in a climate-friendly way
