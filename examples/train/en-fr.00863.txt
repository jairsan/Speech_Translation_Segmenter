madam president this telecoms package is of very great interest to many citizens in my own country of ireland and indeed across the european union and rightly so
as meps i hope that we can send a strong message on behalf of those citizens that we are in favour of a free internet where the privacy of users and their rights are respected fully
today we must stand behind the block of citizens amendments that have been tabled as the best way of defending those rights of our citizens
these amendments if passed will restore some sort of balance between end users rights and freedoms and the rights and freedoms of others including the right to intellectual property protection and indeed the right to privacy
the aim of this proposal should be to protect those who need protection but also to strengthen the rights of citizens to access information within the law when and where they see fit
service providers should be made to act in a transparent manner at all times and if in very exceptional cases restrictions to access are required they should be fully accountable in justifying these restrictions
national powers should have a role in investigating any restriction that service providers impose
finally i hope that this parliament will stand with our citizens this week in supporting the citizens amendment package thereby standing in favour of the freedom of internet users and civil liberties across the union
