is it not time we had something like a marshall aid plan perhaps a sarkozy plan for europe
how would you fund that
supposing china was to lend money to the european investment bank or the european bank for reconstruction and development and you were to give grants to member states that would not affect their debt gnp ratio
how would you refund it
from the customs and excise that you would collect from trade and perhaps from an extra zero point five vat contribution from the member states who would draw down this facility
will you give consideration at your december meeting to a marshall aid-type plan and stop tinkering at the edges
we are now just entering into this recession and if we take it head on with calculated risk we can see our way through it
