madam president things have improved in zimbabwe but sadly they have not improved enough
we have seen the crackdown on mr maguwu and on other human rights defenders
we have also seen the closure and the arrest of lesbian gay and bisexual people engaged in hiv prevention and advice
if i stand up and speak as an englishman they will dismiss it
as europeans they will dismiss us
but let me say the obvious to the african countries you know what is happening in zimbabwe is wrong
unless you do something about it collectively you will lose any moral authority in the continent and in the world
we talk about africa being in your hands and the future of africa being in your hands
to stand back and do nothing while people are arrested because they seek to expose human rights breaches and to defend ordinary women and men to do nothing africa is to be complicit
