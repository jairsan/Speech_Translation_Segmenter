madam president many european citizens including some whom i represent wanted to ask mr barroso and mr sarkozy whether they thought it was fair that the cost of this financial crisis should be borne by the ordinary european citizen rather than by those banking executives in the united states or in europe who made millions out of acting negligently or even criminally in some cases and who now enjoy their millions by having them in tax-free havens or in secure savings accounts
they also wanted to ask mr barroso and mr sarkozy whether it was fair that when the american economy catches a cold or has cancer it should be the europeans who undergo chemotherapy
yes to cooperation with the americans but no to dependence
