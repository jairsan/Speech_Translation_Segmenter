mr president in the epp group everybody is in favour of following the commission recommendations that fyrom should begin accession negotiations
we also know that fyrom and greece need to reach an agreement on the name issue so that these negotiations can begin
the name issue is a real political issue in greece
no greek government can survive if negotiations are allowed to begin without an agreement on the name
this is a political reality
irrespective of how colleagues judge this issue if we want to be good advisers we must give fyrom friendly flexible advice
by dismissing the name issue calling it comical for instance we become bad advisers to fyrom and we do not serve its cause
turkey should know how large the turkish dossier is for a country with its size of population
it regards the capacity of the eu to absorb such an enlargement the budgetary constraints and so on so turkey should understand how much easier and without obstacles and frozen chapters her accession road would be without the weight of the problem of cyprus
it needs to contribute on the issue of guarantees the presence of troops and the right of unilateral military intervention that cyprus does not need
