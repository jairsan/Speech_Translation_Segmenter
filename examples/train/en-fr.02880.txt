mr president in the anglo-american world the primary purpose of the law is to protect people from random arrest and arbitrary imprisonment
the law in continental europe in particular the former eastern bloc simply does not have that priority and it is ridiculous to pretend otherwise
under the european arrest warrant everybody in britain can be extradited under bulgarian law for example and there is not much a british judge can do about it
to make matters worse the british government has opted into the european investigation order which is a further attack on the liberties of the british people
the liberal democrats who sponsor all this call themselves the party of civil liberties
this is piffle the liberal democrats commitment to civil liberties comes to a grinding halt at calais
