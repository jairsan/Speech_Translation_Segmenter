madam president on nine july south sudan will declare independence as an english-speaking new african state
the eu has rightly supported the cpap's process and referendum in south sudan
however the next few months will remain critical
south sudan must be enabled to establish itself as a viable sovereign state
even without a hostile neighbour to the north south sudan faces enormous developmental challenges
infrastructure is largely non-existent
there is widespread intercommunal hostility
health care indicators are amongst the worst in the world and the economy is almost completely dependent on oil exports
it is therefore essential to increase eu developmental and humanitarian aid to south sudan
however south sudan also needs the eu's unequivocal support politically
the recent seizure of the disputed border region of abyei by the khartoum government suggests that president bashir is still not fully reconciled to his country's partition
lastly i am also hopeful that south sudan will live up to its promise and be the first african union country to re-recognise the stable and democratic republic of somaliland as an independent country also
