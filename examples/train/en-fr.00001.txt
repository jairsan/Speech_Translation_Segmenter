mr president i know that i will not be popular for making a long speech at this time but my two fellow-rapporteurs with whom i have worked very closely as a team have made short statements so i want to keep the team spirit together
i would just like to say that there are more amendments in my report because my committee has been more ambitious in the improvements it wanted to make to the commission proposal
i ask for your support to ensure that we have confident well-informed consumers for electronic communications who are also secure and know that their personal data is protected
i would like to thank all my colleagues on the committee who worked with me to put together some really big compromise amendments which we will pass today
i would like particularly to thank alexander alvaro and the civil liberties committee with whom we worked very closely for their part on the e-privacy directive
i would like all of you to give us a huge majority for this so that when we come to negotiate with the commission and council we will do our very best for europe's consumers
