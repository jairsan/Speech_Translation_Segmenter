mr president developments in azerbaijan regarding democracy and human rights continue to be a matter of serious concern to all of us
over the last few years we have noted a worrying trend of increasing restrictions in this domain
parliamentary elections held on seven november twenty ten were not sufficient to constitute meaningful progress in the democratic development of that country
there are other areas where we believe that azerbaijan needs to improve its record of meeting fully its council of europe and osce commitments
first of all media freedom overall there is a lack of media pluralism
there are also reports of harassment of and violence against journalists as well as questionable judicial proceedings against media representatives
individual cases in this field remain a concern
freedom of assembly is another area where i am deeply worried
the recent months have witnessed several severe actions taken by the authorities vis-Ã -vis organised protests as well as attempts to organise protests inspired by the arab spring revolutions
the detention of activists and other repressive measures against protesters are deeply deplorable
the european union has a responsibility to convey clear messages on the importance of democracy human rights and respect for the rule of law
such messages were passed on by president barroso himself during his visit to baku in january and will be high on our agenda for future visits
human rights and democracy are cornerstones in our cooperation with azerbaijan under the existing partnership and cooperation agreement
last year we established a new subcommittee on justice freedom security and human rights and democracy
democracy and human rights are also a central theme in our negotiations on a new association agreement
i welcome the willingness of azerbaijan to discuss these methods
i also welcome the role the european parliament plays in advocating democratic values to the partners in azerbaijan including through its work in the eu-azerbaijan cooperation committee
