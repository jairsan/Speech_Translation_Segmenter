madam president first of all i would like to thank the rapporteur and chair of the committee on agriculture and rural development mr parish and the members of the committee on agriculture for the report
i could be very short and just reassure you but i have to read the speaking points
we have been working very hard at simplifying the common agricultural policy cap
a single common market organisation cmo covering all agricultural sectors is a keystone of this effort
it allows for streamlining legislation across sectors whilst taking into account the specifications of particular products
it has also substantially reduced the volume of cap legislation
this commission proposal aims at completing the single cmo project by integrating the wine sector also
without wine the single cmo would simply remain incomplete
we would stop part way through the process and lose many of the benefits of the projects
we have always intended to include wine
indeed both the initial single cmo proposal and the recent wine reform were drafted and adopted on that basis
i am glad to say that the european parliament has always fully endorsed the single cmo project including the integration of fruit and vegetables and wine after the completion of the reforms in those sectors
the single cmo and its management committee has been working very well for other sectors and there has been no particular criticism of it
the proposal for integration might seem complex at first sight
but this is inherent in the nature of amending legislation
after incorporation consolidated versions of the single cmo will become available which will show very clearly the wine provisions
the integration of the single cmo will not make any substantive changes to the policy decided in the wine reform
the services of my colleague mrs fischer boel will work hard with the european parliament and the council to ensure that this is the case
we did this very successfully during the integration of the equally complex fruit and vegetables sector
i would therefore ask you to help the commission to help my colleague to continue her and our simplification work and give a positive opinion on this proposal
