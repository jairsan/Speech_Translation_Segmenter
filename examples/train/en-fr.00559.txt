madam president i abstained on this report because i believe it simply does not go far enough
we have previously made commitments in this house to reduce emissions
transport has a key role to play in the fight against climate change and should be assisted in meeting its responsibility but this report will do little to help
this is unfortunate because there are some good proposals
the noise charges for trains take into account the broader environmental impact of transport and fit well with the proposals currently going through the committee on industry research and energy on reducing noise in car tyres
much more could have been done for the aviation sector however
it is odd that the report mentions rail sea and inland waterway transport yet neglects this sector one of the principal contributors of carbon emissions
it is because it lacks teeth in this area and so many others that i abstained on this report
