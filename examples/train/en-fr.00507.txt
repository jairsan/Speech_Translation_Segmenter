madam president it was with great pleasure that i voted for this report and i wish mrs dahl well on her maternity leave
unfortunately she could not be here today
it was a telling point that as a member of her ind dem group she was willing to be rapporteur to play a constructive role in the work of our parliament unlike her colleagues from the so-called uk independence party who i believe if i am right have never been rapporteurs for any report in this parliament in the four-and-a-half years since a motley crew of twelve of them were elected at the last european elections
all they do is snipe from the sidelines usually on the basis of ignorance because they are unwilling to get engaged in the real work that we are doing across the political spectrum in this house to ensure that the legislation and policies the union produces are properly scrutinised and are a fair balance of interests of our different member states and our different political viewpoints
all they want to do is be negative and oppose everything
what a contrast between them and their colleague
