mr president despite the past protestations from the vietnamese government that they guarantee religious freedom and despite the best efforts of the last speaker to whitewash the regime in vietnam the reality is very different particularly for isolated christian groups
while confiscation of church property has been rife those linked to unregistered evangelical house churches have been particular targets for state persecution
just months ago a young tribal man who refused to repudiate his christian faith died from injuries inflicted under official interrogation hundreds remain in prison for their faith where ill-treatment is rampant
i salute their courage i condemn their persecutors but above all i appeal to this eu not to put improving relations with vietnam and trade above defending and demanding basic human rights for these human beings of very great faith
we must not for the sake of trade or other short-term gain sanitise the outrageous human rights record of hanoi
