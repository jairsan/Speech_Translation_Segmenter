mr president the visa issue is very important to all belarusians
but i would like to highlight a specific situation with regard to travel
the chernobyl children's project international founded by adi roche in ireland brings approximately one zero children from belarus to ireland each year for a few weeks for rest recuperation and in some cases ongoing medical interventions
in total seventeen zero children have come since the charity started
unfortunately permission has been withdrawn for the children to come to ireland and this has devastated everybody concerned the children their host families and so many others
this is such a good project and everybody benefits
an intergovernmental agreement is being worked on and i hope it will be finalised soon but in the meantime i know that ireland is seeking an exemption from the ban
i would ask the commission and the council perhaps in its informal dialogue to do all they can to ensure the continuation of this very worthwhile project
i know it is just a small part of the overall situation but it will make such a positive difference to so many lives
