mr president i think i made it very clear in my speech that i do not want a secular tyrant or an islamist theocrat running any of the countries in our neighbourhood
i would of course like a liberal democrat prepared to stand for free and fair elections
i think that the economic situation and high levels of unemployment in tunisia and egypt are a serious problem and we must do all we can to address that
but that is not the issue here
the issue basically now is to see an orderly and peaceful transition in these countries and not a breakdown in law and order
we want to see stability peace and of course democracy in our neighbourhood
