madam president i would like to thank the rapporteur
i shall be very specific in relation to agriculture and to two paragraphs in the report which i think are not necessary
the report would perhaps be better without them
they are very specific in relation to meat consumption and i do not think there is a place for these paragraphs in the report
the following paragraph on feed rations ignores the reality of research that has been going on for a long number of years in many member states seeking to do exactly what it says in this paragraph which is therefore out of date with reality
one of the areas that i think needs to be enhanced is the communication of how farmers and those who use the land can farm in a way that is more climatically friendly
i think there has been a failure of the researchers to work with the farmers and we need more effort in relation to extension services to get the message across to encourage and not to coerce
