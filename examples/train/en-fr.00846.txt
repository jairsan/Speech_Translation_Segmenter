madam president i warmly welcome the revision of the criteria governing the european globalisation adjustment fund
we are now at a time of deep economic crisis the deepest since the end of the second world war
we therefore need innovative solutions to tackle the enormous economic problems we are faced with
the european globalisation adjustment fund is one such example
i was the first irish member of this house to identify the possibility to deploy these funds in the recent job crises in limerick waterford and tralee three important locations in my own constituency
i therefore welcome the work of the rapporteurs to make the criteria for application more flexible in the light of the economic crisis
special mention should be made of the new ratio of funding between the commission and member states plus the temporary lowering of the threshold for unemployment from one zero to five hundred
i believe that these reforms will send a strong signal from the heart of europe to those unfortunate enough to be buffeted by the gale-force winds of economic crisis that there is help available to them to help themselves retrain and upskill their way to future prosperity
