mr president due to a combination of vaccinations and restrictions on animal movement the number of outbreaks of bluetongue has fallen significantly in recent years
the disease causes intense suffering and death amongst the affected animals and has a measurable negative impact on the rural economy and the farming community
i welcome measures allowing member states to use inactivated vaccination against bluetongue in areas not affected by the disease and thank the rapporteur for his work on this issue
member states should be allowed the flexibility to be proactive and draw upon technological advances in vaccine production thus reducing the burden on the agricultural sector posed by this disease and preventing occurrence without negating the disease-free status of the member states as was previously the case
vaccination represents an effective veterinary measure in response to bluetongue which when accompanied by further measures such as surveillance means that eradication of the disease in europe is a real possibility
vaccination in controlling and eventually eradicating the disease will result in reduced economic losses and would be of benefit to european livestock
