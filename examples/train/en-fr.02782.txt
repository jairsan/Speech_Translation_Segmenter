mr president just to add an irish voice to this debate i too share the disillusionment with the extent of nationalism across this floor
i am disappointed that the chamber is half empty for what is the most important debate for europe in this session
on interest rates let us be very clear that countries should not be charged penal interest rates
they do not help them to recover and they do not help debt sustainability
in my last thirty seconds could i ask the commission to address the issue of debt sustainability for ireland and our colleagues who are in difficulty
could i also ask a question about the political capacity of the european union
on monday in our parliament in dublin i spoke about a sundering of solidarity in the european union
i do not say that with any delight
i have said it privately to the commissioner
it is a real and serious problem
i rue the day when we might be ruled by the extreme right or the extreme left
for god's sake let the centre unite
