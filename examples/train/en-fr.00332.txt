madam president like other colleagues i should like to say that this was a very difficult dossier
while diana wallis was concerned about peas you can imagine that in ireland potatoes were certainly on our menu and on the agenda
overall however i believe that what we voted on is a much better proposal and package than the original one on the table and i compliment those who worked on it
let me say a few things about this and i will end up with the key point
i think we are now in a position where farmers need to lobby the agrochemical industry to produce safer alternatives so that they can continue to produce food and i think as much energy should go into that lobby as has gone heretofore
when it comes to food imports the commission need to address the genuine concerns of eu farmers and producers that they will be banned from using certain substances but third countries continue to use them
we need an explanation of that in order to bring farmers with us
