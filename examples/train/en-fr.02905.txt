madam president i would like to thank the honourable lady for accepting my question
i have two questions
would you first of all accept that this is not just a german debate and that there are other elements to this discussion
because it has seemed to be rather an internal german discussion and there are different views about this
secondly would you not accept that the circumstances faced by fukushima were quite extraordinary and unprecedented both in terms of the strength of the earthquake the strongest ever experienced in japan and the height of the tsunami which reached a maximum i am told of forty-six metres and had an average height of fourteen metres conditions that we might not expect in europe
