madam president the political economic and humanitarian situation in zimbabwe is going from bad to worse with the threat of a generalised outbreak of cholera and other potential epidemics adding to the already dire conditions in which the zimbabwean people find themselves
it is now absolutely clear that mr mugabe cares very little about the well-being of his countrymen
he cares much more about living a life of personal luxury and extravagance
mr mugabe has proved beyond any reasonable doubt that he is totally unfit to govern his country in the modern world
he finds excuses for his political existence by pretending to fight the ghosts of the long bygone british colonial era
there is no way we europeans can convince mr mugabe to see reason
the only chance to force him to step down is a drastic change in the stance held by the african union
it is shameful that this organisation has not intervened in a much more decisive and resolute manner already
i believe that our efforts must be directed at the african union and the governments of the nations it consists of
we must make it absolutely clear to them that we hold them wholly responsible for the sorry state of affairs in zimbabwe and expect them even at this very late stage to take proper drastic action to get mr mugabe's regime to step down and go home or face severe consequences not excluding trial for crimes against humanity
