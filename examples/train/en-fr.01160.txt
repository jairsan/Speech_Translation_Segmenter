mr president everyone agrees that climate change is the biggest challenge facing humanity that is the constant claim of the political elite and it is a lie
everyone does not agree
thousands of scientists dispute the very existence of man-made global warming citing natural cyclical changes that saw vineyards in roman northern england and a swedish army march over the frozen baltic to copenhagen in sixteen fifty-eight
as an army of global-warming zealots marches to copenhagen the truth is that their orwellian consensus is based not on scientific agreement but on bullying censorship and fraudulent statistics
in the words of leading climatologist professor lindzen future generations will wonder in bemused amazement that the early twenty-first century's developed world went into hysterical panic over a globally averaged temperature increase of a few tenths of a degree and on the basis of gross exaggerations of highly uncertain computer projections contemplated a rollback of the industrial age
in fact there will be no bemused amazement for the reason for this hysteria is clear
it is designed to provide the excuse for a political project of the globalists to replace national democracy with new world order global governance
it has nothing to do with science and everything to do with the globalist common purpose to tax and control us while making billions for corporations in the green industrial complex
the anti-western intellectual cranks of the left suffered a collective breakdown when communism collapsed
climate change is their new theology a secular religious hysteria complete with pope al gore carbon-credit indulgences and the persecution of heretics
but the heretics will have a voice in copenhagen and the truth will out
climate change is being used to impose an anti-human utopia as deadly as anything conceived by stalin or mao
