mr president claude moraes talked about the lack of proportionality etc
we can all agree on that but the one thing the elephant in the room that nobody has talked about this afternoon is the fact that the court cannot look at the prima facie evidence against the accused person and exercise any discretion about whether they should be extradited or not
we have many constituents affected by this
the most notable case is andrew symeou
i sat through the appeal court hearings and heard the judges
it was obvious from the look on their faces that they realised there was no real evidence against this boy the evidence was contradictory the statements appeared to have been concocted by the police and in no way should he have been extradited
how would you address that problem and the fact that the courts cannot take into account the prima facie evidence or lack of it against an accused person
