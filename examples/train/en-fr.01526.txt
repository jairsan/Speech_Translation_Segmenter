madam president it is a pleasure to see you back in the chair
we occasionally get these messages coming out of the commission that the eu is doing enough
it should do less but do it better concentrate on the really big things
and then we have all these motions on things like what pets we are allowed to take where
i think there is an issue of proportionality here is there not
countries have different national conditions
our country is an island without land borders and we are perfectly capable of reaching sensible proportionate bilateral or multilateral agreements with each other
do we really think that we would be better off creating a new administrative bureaucracy in the hands of the same geniuses who brought us the common agricultural policy the common fisheries policy the unaudited budgets and all of the rest of the apparatus of acquired eu law
surely this is something that could be left to the member states
