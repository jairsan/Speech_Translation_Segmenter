mr president i have just one issue to raise here which is the scandalous saga of the land-grab laws in spain which has been before the committee on petitions in one form or another these past six years
throughout this house all of us will have constituents whatever our nationality who have been suffering from abuses under the urbanisation law in the spanish costas as indeed thousands of spanish citizens are
the attempts to bring this matter to judgment in this house have been shamefully frustrated by a number of spanish deputies in both parties and i would particularly appeal to my colleagues in the spanish partido popular to remember the importance of the sanctity of property
they of all people should understand knowing their history and knowing what happened in the second republic when ownership was not secure how important it is that people should feel that their title deeds are not up for violation by state abuses
