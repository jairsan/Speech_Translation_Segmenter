mr president the security of our citizens is of paramount interest to us all and it is all too easy for us to be painted as soft on fighting terrorism when we stand and ask for the civil liberties of our citizens to be protected
i have seen that happen time and time again by many national parliamentarians when it comes to actions that this house takes
swift has of course many examples of success and we support all of those examples but it is equally important also to concentrate our minds on those instances where swift has failed or let us down
there have been many failed or bad investigations in the european union
in my constituency alone twelve innocent people were detained and were not able to be charged
at the time they were detained we were informed that financial transactions were part of the substantial evidence against them
what can we learn from those bad instances
council let us step back
we have time
our backs are not against the wall
there is a way forward
let us defer
council go back do this properly not for the sake of this house but for the sake of our citizens
