madam president we have here an ambitious plan
a plan to do nothing less than save the world a big job at the best of times
when the draft report was first presented by mr florenz to the committee its first call to action was that we bear in mind that we humans are protectors of creation
this simple statement was the first to be attacked and removed
what was so objectionable to the committee
the word creation
why
because creation has a creator
it does not matter to me how the universe was created or in what time frame
what is important to me is that there is a god and that we are stewards who must as amendment twenty-two puts it safeguard creation
so as i say we are here today setting ourselves the task of saving the world setting a course of action that will require the cooperation and sacrifice of everyone everywhere a task which to be successful will also require the cooperation of the winds water and the sun
but even knowing this we are at the same time making it clear as we have done in the past with other great challenges that we think we can take on the enormous and urgent challenges that face mankind without help from above
well all i can say is good luck with it and may god spare us
