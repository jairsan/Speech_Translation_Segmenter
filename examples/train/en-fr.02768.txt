the eu is still a very limited global actor its role in the un system and in all multilateral organisations does not match its democratic economic and cultural weight
this report addressed this deficit and calls for removing some obstacles to the full participation of our union to the global context
this is the reason why i voted in favour of it
the eu can make a powerful contribution to the peace and prosperity of our planet
let us allow its civilian power to expand its influence everywhere
