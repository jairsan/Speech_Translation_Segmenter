mr president i would like to thank mr dess for a comprehensive report
like other speakers i would like to emphasise the importance of an adequate budget for the new cap
i believe that it is hugely important to base our budget on the arguments around food security
it is estimated that by twenty fifty we will need a seventy increase in global agricultural production
i would argue that the new cap should aid this and keep that production within europe
we should not be doing anything to hamper the food production base that we already have
i welcome the clear support for the two-pillar structure and i also welcome today's affirmation from the commissioner of his support for that as well
however i would have to add that i do not want to see the support for greening in pillar one imposing further burdens and costs on our farmers
for that reason i would like to see flexibility at national and regional level given the wide diversity of farm structures and land bases across the eu
