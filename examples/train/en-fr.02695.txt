mr president i am glad to hear that a majority of the icelanders in recent opinion polls say that they have no intention of joining the eu because frankly why do we want them to join
what exactly are they going to bring to our european club
they have got a collapsed economy their banks have defaulted their volcano closed our airspace for nine days i presume we would have to pick up the bill for that if it happens again and now they are plundering our mackerel stocks
in two thousand and five iceland landed three hundred and sixty-seven tonnes of north-east atlantic mackerel
this year they intend to land one hundred and fifty zero tonnes
what kind of good management sustainable management of fisheries do you call that
they always pride themselves on having a sustainable fishery and they laugh at the common fisheries policy that we employ
this is almost criminal
this is almost illegal fishing and there is no way we should invite them to join the eu
