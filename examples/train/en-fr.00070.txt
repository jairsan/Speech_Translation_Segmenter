madam president this has been batted to and fro between the commission and the council ever since two thousand and two six years
there has been no common position until june of this year but now they pass it to parliament like a hot potato
is this sudden change of mind due to the current economic downturn i wonder
whether that is so or not it will not help in these times of rising unemployment because the report says that temporary workers are to be paid the same as permanent full-time workers
wrong at one end temporary agencies use this to get young people a start in life or another go
at the other end inexperienced workers will be paid the same as experienced long-time employees which goes right against established practice
this discourages employee loyalty which every firm needs
more experience equals more skill equals more pay
it is a bad move
reject it
