mr president last year's mission letter from president barroso to professor monti asked him to take a fresh look at how the market and social dimensions of an integrated european economy can be mutually strengthened
in his turn in the report professor monti launched a strong appeal for political consensus saying that consensus building will thus be a crucial component of a new strategy for the single market
the effort to generate consensus will have to show full awareness of the main concerns surrounding the single market today
for us achieving that consensus requires a new balance between the social and economic pillars of the internal market strategy
now i know commissioner barnier that you indeed realise that and i commend you for your personal efforts to bring about that balanced consensus
but sadly others in the college did not share that realisation and so while there are good elements in this communication as my colleagues have said we do not think that at the moment it forms the basis for that consensus
i hope our groups in this house can work together effectively to try to strike the correct balance and achieve that consensus and i hope that at the end of the consultation period the college of the commission will take note of that and produce a balanced consensual package
i would dearly like commissioner to see the track-changes text in relation to proposals twenty-nine and thirty it would be intriguing i think to see who is responsible for the changes and the very special language used there
some members have referred to the social clause proposal twenty-nine and i think that proposal thirty is very important
i note there the reference to the need for a legislative proposal which is likely to include or be supplemented by a clarification of the exercise of fundamental rights in the context of the economic freedoms of the internal market
one way of reading that commissioner is that it is referring to what has come to be termed the monti ii regulation
i hope that this is the case because it would directly address our concern about the social clause
we will work with you in the coming months on this
