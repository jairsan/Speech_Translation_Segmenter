mr president congratulations to all of those concerned with this report and congratulations to the swedish presidency
societies are changed not by mediocrity but by courage conviction and vision
and that has been displayed here in parliament this afternoon
we are talking about freedom security and justice three fundamental principles
yet without equality and equality of treatment you will never have freedom you will never have security and you will certainly never have justice
that applies most particularly to minorities who are so often maligned and misrepresented
equality and equality of treatment are the only durable building blocks of any civilised society
and that is why i am proud to promote and associate myself with a europe where we are all equal regardless of race ethnicity religion belief age disability gender or sexual orientation a europe of equals a europe of fundamental values
