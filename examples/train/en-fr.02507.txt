madam president if we want the europe twenty twenty strategy to be a success then the employment guidelines have to be implemented effectively and national reform programmes put in place and given the priority they actually deserve
we have to make sure that no one is left behind
unemployment rates among older people and disabled people are disgracefully high
i am pleased that both texts refer to the need to implement anti-discrimination laws in the workplace so that jobs are open for all
it is important that the targets we have agreed at eu level are actually achieved
yes it is up to member states to set specific targets and adhere to them but the european union has an important role to play in improving the exchange of best practice
that is why i am pleased that paragraph twenty-seven of the committee resolution makes this very clear
we have had months of introspection and debates about what shape the europe twenty twenty strategy should take but we have the employment guidelines
now is the time to start delivering on them
