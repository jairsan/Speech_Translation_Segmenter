madam president let me express my admiration for the stoic japanese resilience in the face of these mighty forces of nature
we must remember the extraordinary strength of the earthquake and of the tsunami
i welcome the precautionary stress tests on european nuclear power plants while remembering that the nuclear industry is already the most regulated and safety conscious in the world and i note the statement earlier this year from wenra the western european nuclear regulators association about making new reactors even safer than our existing ones
it is salutary to compare the safety records of the coal oil and hydroelectric industries with that of the nuclear industry in terms of accidents involving loss of life
madam president i see a silver lining in this awful cloud for japan namely that the rebuilding and restoration work in that country courtesy of the deep pockets of the insurance industry should give a huge boost to their economy and that will be good for the rest of the world
i thank the minister and the commissioner for their thoughtful remarks and i would say to member states and everyone else do not go wobbly on nuclear power now we need it too much
