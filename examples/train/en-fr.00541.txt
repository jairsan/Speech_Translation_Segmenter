thank you commissioner
i particularly welcome the conference that is going to take place and indeed we can be very proud of the standard of our food products in europe i certainly agree with you on that
i want to refer however to the proposed compulsory electronic identification of sheep which commences in january twenty ten and which the commission is determined to press ahead with despite the opposition of the agricultural committee members and the farming organisations
we have as members challenged the operational and cost implications of the compulsory electronic identification and the disastrous consequences for an industry already in serious decline
would the commission consider granting a further deferral or removing the compulsory nature of this proposal
failing that would the commission consider meeting the additional costs of compulsory electronic identification
