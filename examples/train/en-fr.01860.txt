mr president i voted in favour of the agreement between the european union and the united states to share financial data for the purposes of terrorist finance tracking
we are well aware of the threat terrorism poses to our own security as well as that of our partners across the atlantic
i do not need to remind you of all the terrorist attacks that have taken place on european soil throughout the last decade
it is also obvious that our american partners represent a very important strategic ally not only in the area of global security but also economically and in other areas as well
the commitment to such a strategic partnership was clearly expressed by vice president joe biden in this house just a few months ago
we should therefore be proud that we finally gave consent to the agreement that is so important for efforts to track terrorist activities especially since the new agreement contains significant improvements and clarifications made by the european parliament have been largely taken into account
