madam president magna carta and habeas corpus are the bedrocks upon which the american constitution was written
they are also the bedrock upon which the laws of my country have been written
you cannot charge someone and lock him up without accusing him and having a trial
however year after year in this parliament we condemned president bush for what he did with guant√°namo bay
now we have a situation where president obama has quite correctly decided to do away with it
when the american executive president has listened to what we have had to say surely it is up to us to encourage member states to take on the burden of our american allies
however that is not a matter that this parliament can dictate to other parliaments
it is for the national parliaments to decide that it is in their interests to help the americans in their time of need
