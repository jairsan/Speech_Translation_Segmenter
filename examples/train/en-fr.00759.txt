commissioner with over six million european citizens suffering from dementia and many millions more europeans having to care for them or being affected by this critical disease i warmly welcome the commission's decision to make this a public health priority
that was a comprehensive answer
but could i ask when you discuss the disability action plan that you as a commissioner and as a commission bear in mind that the effect of alzheimer's is a cross-cutting effect across disability the field of ageing and public health and that you maintain a comprehensive strategy not just identifying alzheimer's but including all the related aspects and that you maintain your priority
this is a public health emergency for an ageing population
but thank you for that comprehensive answer
