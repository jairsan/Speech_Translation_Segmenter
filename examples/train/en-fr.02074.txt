madam president we live in challenging economic times and many small businesses feel burdened with eu red tape and its associated cost
i believe that first and foremost this house and the commission should be looking at ways to alleviate the financial burden of the red tape that we insist upon here
in respect of this proposal we need to strike a balance between the opening-up of markets for european products and ensuring the quality and safety of imported products
i must say however that i do see merit in third-country labelling when it comes to food products
i know they are not covered by the scope of this proposal but many of northern ireland's farmers feel let down when they work hard to meet the requirements laid down by europe and then have to compete with those who do not have to meet the same standards
i hope the commissioner will take note that those of us who represent rural and agricultural-based communities have not forgotten the resumption of talks with mercosur countries and we hope that he is not prepared to sacrifice our agricultural industry for further markets
this place has a habit of taking legislation too far and i fear that this is what is happening in this particular case
