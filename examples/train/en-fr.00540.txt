thank you for your very detailed reply commissioner
you talked about the measures you have taken to stop the downward spiral of prices
as you are well aware milk prices at the moment are below production prices
many dairy farmers are hanging on by their fingernails
i am very pleased to hear you say that you will be willing to take all the necessary steps
by that are you saying that you would be prepared to make greater use of some of the dairy management tools that are at your disposal such as export refunds aid to private storage and intervention
i would like you to clarify that for me please
