madam president since two thousand and six when the first interruption of gas supply from russia took place energy security has become a top item agenda on the eu's activity
the issue is not only economic but highly political too because it has a strong impact on the foreign policy of the eu and consequently on its international standing
in spite of the fact that this is widely recognised in practice the eu is incapable of stopping its increasing dependence on energy supplies from actors with strong political agendas who do not hesitate to exploit the eu's increasing vulnerability
this is due to the resistance of some new important members
however to conclude it would be wrong to say that there is no current energy security system there is it is just that it is individual and not collective with each eu country wanting to protect itself through preferential relations with individual suppliers for whose favours they are sometimes ready to compete fiercely
