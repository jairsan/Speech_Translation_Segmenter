mr president first of all i would to thank the rapporteur for her outstanding work in trying to consolidate the positions of all the groups of the european parliament
regarding this report i would like to highlight the importance of addressing the situation of immigrants in libya trying to cross the mediterranean
i can fully understand the concerns of the southern member states relating to the flow of illegal immigrants and the pressure it puts on their budgets as well as on society in general
however while keeping in mind the interests of member states we cannot set aside european values
the eu cannot afford to have the blood of any asylum-seeker or refugee on its hands
no agreement of the eu and its member states with libya should lead to the inhuman treatment torture or execution of anyone
therefore it was encouraging to hear from the commissioner that he sees progress in eu-libya relations and negotiations
