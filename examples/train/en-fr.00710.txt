mr president i supported this report because i believe it continues the crucial work done by this house in linking our commitment to the environment to our need to deliver member states out of the current financial crisis
but also because every aspect of our economy and society is affected we need to take a holistic approach to economic and environmental recovery
i worked in housing for eighteen years and i am concerned that sufficient attention has not been paid to housing and energy especially at construction time as housing contributes significantly to carbon emissions
focusing on cohesion policy is a sensible way for us to fulfil our obligation to communities and economies
change as much else begins at home
using the european development fund monies to complement regional and local authorities <unk> for double glazing insulation and solar panels or for replacing old boilers for more energy-efficient ones is an excellent example of how the european union can help member states to meet targets which will be of benefit to all european citizens
