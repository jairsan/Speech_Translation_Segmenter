mr president i want to support paragraph twenty-two which like the van nistelrooij report calls for member states to strengthen the partnership principle in their programmes for the current period and in accordance with article eleven of the general regulation of the erdf the esf and the cohesion funds
we in parliament write these regulations but it is up to the member states to implement these regulations and it is up to the commission to monitor their implementation
a recent report about the involvement of ngos and others in the development implementation and monitoring of the structural funds in the new member states was entitled the illusion of inclusion and i think the title says it all
member states and the commission are not shouldering their responsibilities
we in this parliament must continue to insist that they do
