i do not agree
we are not there
in fact as you know the creation of the institutional position of high representative vice-president of the commission is one of the most important innovations of the lisbon treaty and the idea is to put together what typically we call intergovernmental competences and community competences
for the common foreign and security policy it will remain basically intergovernmental it is the prerogative of the member states
but there are other community competences that should not go now to the intergovernmental arm
it should be kept of course in the community method
so the high representative vice-president of the commission is as we say usually double-hatted
she will have to put together using the best of the synergies those two competences
so there will be of course competences that she will be able to develop inside the commission as vice-president of the commission but working also hand-in-hand with the member states and with the council
i think that is the contribution to have more coherent and consistent external relations of the european union to reinforce the defence of our interests and promote our values in the world
