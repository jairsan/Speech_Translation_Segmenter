commissioner i hear what you say but it does have echoes of the brazilian beef controversy when for months the commission stood where you stand today and assured us that all was well and then was finally driven to the position of having to impose a ban
you have said that this meat will be subjected to similar tests
can you say without reservation that every piece of meat imported will be equally subjected to the same rigorous veterinary tests as are required of our own producers
will the same ratio of production be tested and how will you know if the product is truly from shandong province
is it enough if it is merely processed there
those are the issues that give rise to resentment by our producers that they are subjected to all sorts of requirements including the phasing-out of cages
will that happen in china at the same rate
they believe themselves undercut by cheap imports
