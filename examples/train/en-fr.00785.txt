madam president i would like to use my speaking time by responding to some of your questions and comments in this in my view very responsible exchange of views today
i shall start with mr watson's remarks concerning visas and human rights but first i have to comment on his remarks concerning my colleague benita ferrero-waldner who is responsible for our relations with moldova
you said benita is an instinctive optimist
i can defend her and the commission's position first by saying that in fact the commission position is very realistic and balanced
secondly you have to be a professional optimist to be a european commissioner at least if you are responsible for eu enlargement and relations for south-eastern europe
concerning the visa question we are indeed dismayed by moldova's decision to impose a visa requirement on romanian citizens
this is not acceptable
we are examining the legality of this move
we will pursue the issue on thirty april on the eve of labour day one may with the moldovan authorities within the context of the commission-moldova joint management committee which has been created under the visa facilitation agreement
overall concerning the elections their aftermath and human rights violations the commission strongly condemned the violence that erupted in the streets of <unk> on seven april and the massive and excessive use of force by the law enforcement agencies forces and reportedly by private militia in the aftermath
reports of widespread human rights violations with respect to detainees as well as of abductions are of serious concern
we see that realistically it is of the utmost importance for moldova to live up to its european aspirations that allegations of human rights violations be investigated thoroughly and impartially with the participation of all political forces and as appropriate under international scrutiny
those suspected of having committed criminal acts including human rights abuses must be investigated and if charged with such acts offered the right to a fair trial
finally on the likely impact of the election aftermath on eu-moldova relations it has brought to the fore the unfinished nature of moldova's internal reforms particularly with regard to the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms
we expect all concerned parties in moldova the official authorities as well as the political opposition and civil society to agree on and progress towards a solution to the current crisis that will bring about more not less democracy and freedom for the moldovan people
the history of what has become the european union is concrete proof that dialogue and cooperation and the rule of law can yield a coherent and sustainable mix of respect for fundamental freedoms political stability and economic prosperity
