mr president i was interested to read the first sentence where it says that the fund has been created in order to provide additional assistance to workers suffering from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns
but have we not always had major changes in world trade patterns
in my constituency of london we had textile companies that responded and prepared for globalisation by outsourcing some of their functions to poorer countries thereby creating jobs in developing countries but keeping high-value research and development and marketing jobs in london in the constituency in the european union
why then if these companies can respond are we rewarding inefficient textile and it companies who bury their heads in the sand and hope that globalisation will go away
surely this money should be returned to taxpayers so they can spend it as they see fit
surely it is time for governments to focus on creating the right conditions so that when jobs are lost entrepreneurs can come along and create new jobs
