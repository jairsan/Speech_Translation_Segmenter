mr president the eu's harmonise everything policy creates many casualties not least the instrument meteorological conditions imc rating for private pilots in the uk
this is a vital safety rating that enables holders to fly on instruments in cloud and poor visibility which is not permitted by the private pilot's licence
it is unique to the uk because of our capricious weather conditions and it also has a very good safety record
in developing a harmonised european pilot's licence the european aviation safety agency is about to wipe out the imc rating leaving many private pilots unable to fly unless they can guarantee cloudless skies for the entirety of their trip
this is a bit like guaranteeing that england will win the world cup on a penalty shootout
after losing visual perspective an untrained pilot has about fifty seconds to regain it before losing control of his aircraft
therefore the abolition of the imc rating is a serious threat to the safety and future of private flying
the european aviation safety agency must think again
this is yet another example of sensible practical british law being subordinated to over-the-top and expensive eu legislation
