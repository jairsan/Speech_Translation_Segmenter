mr president i was not fortunate enough to be on the parliament delegation in cancún but i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate everyone who was involved
i was perhaps a bit of a cynic about whether these sorts of meetings could achieve anything but whilst there have been many voices in the press complaining about a lack of detail particularly as jo leinen suggests about lack of detail in the area of financing for the green fund and many other issues that have been left unspecified at this stage i take the optimistic view that this gathering was not the time or the place for dealing with minute detail but was the time to flesh out the global aspirations and talk a bit about strategy and i think that has been achieved
in my group the ecr we believe in light-touch government
we believe that you will achieve more by encouragement not by haranguing and i believe that this is a step closer to that
i can do no better than to close with the words of my prime minister david cameron when he said yesterday the cancún agreement is a very significant step forward in renewing the determination of the international community to tackle climate change through multilateral action
i congratulate every one of my colleagues here who was involved in achieving that
