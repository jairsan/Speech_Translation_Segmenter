mr president france has decided that it does not want vast numbers of uninvited roma turning up on its doorstep but they were invited
this whole problem is a direct result of directive two thousand and four thirty-eight ec on the right to free movement of eu citizens
any eu citizen has the right to live in another eu state
like so much eu legislation it has turned out to be an absurdity in practice
we do not just get highly educated and skilled people with a strong work ethic coming from another member state
it means we have no protection against the entry of socially undesirable and criminal elements
french governments have always been enthusiastic about the european union
they are now finding out the hard way that they cannot have the eu without the roma
the french now want to join the italians and say arrivederci roma
well they cannot
it is better to join with the uk independence party and say goodbye european union
