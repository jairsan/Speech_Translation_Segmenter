i thank the commissioner for her answer and i agree the commission is certainly making some efforts
but given that fifty-three of european citizens are saying they are not interested in the european elections i think one of the reasons for that is that many european citizens are not aware that they can effect change and have an impact through the consultation process my experience from contact with stakeholders in civil society is that very many of them are simply unaware of this process
i myself make an effort every few months to alert stakeholders to the various consultation processes that are ongoing and i genuinely believe and would ask you commissioner if you do not agree that it would be very useful for the commission offices in each country to draw up a list a very wide-ranging list of all stakeholders and ensure that they are alerted to the consultation process so that they would know and could take part
