mr president i am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this joint motion for a resolution on press freedom in kenya
a year ago like many others i was dismayed and disappointed that after flawed presidential elections in kenya street demonstrations led to riots and ethnic clashes that spread across the country killing more than a thousand people and leaving another three hundred and fifty zero people homeless
those responsible for the post-election violence a year ago must be brought to justice and a period of reconciliation and tolerance is now essential for kenya
in this context it is very bad news that on friday two january two thousand and nine president kibaki signed the kenya communications amendment bill two thousand and eight which amends the kenya communications act of nineteen ninety-eight
this bill flies in the face of press freedom and disregards international conventions signed up to by the kenyan government
two sections effectively introduce direct media censorship by the government
section eighty-eight gives the information minister considerable powers to raid and dismantle broadcasting equipment from a media house that is deemed to be a threat to national security
section forty-six gives the state the power to regulate contents to be aired and published by both electronic and print media
within kenya the bill has been opposed by journalists by prime minister odinga and by the odm and its passing highlights a serious lack of consultation within the current grand coalition
i regret the passing of this bill and urge that any revision of the media law takes account of the many many reservations expressed
