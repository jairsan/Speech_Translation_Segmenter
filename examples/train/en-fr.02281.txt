madam president ireland has been mentioned many times in this debate
i would like to start by making it clear that i support deeper economic governance in a european social market economy
we should thank ireland's partners in europe for their solidarity at this time of crisis a crisis created largely by incompetent conservative governments over many years
you will not be surprised that solidarity is being presented by eurosceptics as a loss of ireland's independence
that distortion is heightened by the failure of the commission and the council to engage with this parliament on the memorandum of understanding with ireland
when mr rehn will that memorandum of understanding be brought before this parliament
commissioner rehn one of the meanest conditions and obligations in the memorandum of understanding is the obligation to cut the minimum wage in ireland by eur two zero per year
the irish government is claiming that you demanded that cut mr rehn
can you clarify that matter for this house
a second incomprehensible aspect of this agreement is the three margin which you have demanded
