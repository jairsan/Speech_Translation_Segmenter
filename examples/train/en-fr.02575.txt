mr president the eu is part of the quartet but sadly there is currently not much progress in the peace process between israel and the palestinians
stalemate is likely to continue as long as there is so much unrest and uncertainty in the arab world
certainly from israel's point of view and i declare i am vice-president of the european friends of israel the unpredictable situation in egypt is diverting attention away from the peace process
i welcome the commitment by the military government in egypt to honour the nineteen seventy-nine peace treaty with israel
let us hope that the muslim brotherhood do not prevail in cairo
whatever happens we should make sure that future eu aid to egypt is conditional on retention of the peace treaty with israel
indeed the fact that part of the putative future palestinian state is ruled by hamas which is committed still to israel's annihilation is surely the biggest obstacle to peace
iran also constitutes a threat to the very existence of israel
peace in the region will never be possible as long as tehran continues to fund and arm the fanatics of hezbollah in lebanon
therefore i understand the recent concern in israel at the passage of two iranian warships through the suez canal on their way to syria which is the first time this was allowed to happen since nineteen seventy-nine
egypt getting closer to iran is a very alarming trend
therefore i wish the high representative every success in this diplomatic minefield which lies ahead
