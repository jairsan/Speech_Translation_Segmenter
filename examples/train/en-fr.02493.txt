mr president today we are having a very different debate to the one that took place only a matter of days ago in this chamber
it is essential that the people of egypt should know that we are standing by them
i welcome the fact that our high representative is currently in that part of the world
the people of egypt are now reliant upon the army to come forward and deliver free and fair elections to bring about the sort of society that they have paid for with their lives and blood
it is now for the international community to make sure that we step in to help them build their institutions and allow the political parties to come forward and take part in those election processes
i hope that the european union will play its part in that
finally commissioner the siphoning-off of funds by leaders in developing countries is something we are only too well aware of
it is about time that europe said that we refuse to be used as a vehicle for such people to park their funds any more
