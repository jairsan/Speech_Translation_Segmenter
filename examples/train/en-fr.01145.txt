mr president the commission supports in principle the text of the draft council decision because it is necessary to ensure that the provisions of mutual assistance and administrative cooperation evolve as far as possible in parallel and it is necessary to fix the provisions establishing that the general budget of the european communities will bear the costs relating to the use of the customs information system by the member states
this legal correction should not imply any increase in the budget and it is necessary to ensure greater complementarity with action in the context of cooperation with europol and eurojust by granting the same level of access for these agencies to the customs information system cis including its customs files identification database fide
that being so the commission cannot support parliament's amendment aiming to grant a different level of access to cis fide for europol and eurojust
in general terms the commission welcomes most of the amendments tabled by parliament
in this context i would like to make the following comments
the commission shares the opinion of the rapporteur mr alvaro that it is regrettable that this proposal should be decided in such a hurried manner by the member states prior to the entry into force of the lisbon treaty
in fact the lisbon treaty provides a new legal basis whereby a new regulation could replace the present cis convention a regulation which would have direct effect in member states and not require transposition into national law before becoming operational as is currently the case for regulation ec no seven hundred and sixty-six two thousand and eight on the administrative part of the cis
the commission also shares the opinion of the european parliament that for the data protection supervision of the it application the solution aiming to replace the joint supervisory authority jsa with the european data protection supervisor edps is the most appropriate
combined supervision by jsa and edps would present some risks of possible duplication and overlapping of work
in any case a coordination mechanism including for issuing relevant recommendations should be put in place
