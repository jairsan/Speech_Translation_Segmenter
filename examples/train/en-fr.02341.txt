mr president as has already been stated in this chamber today in the united kingdom almost three-quarters of a million people currently suffer from some form of dementia
sixteen thousand of those live in my constituency in northern ireland
alzheimer's is a cruel disease
it strips sufferers of their personality it takes away their independence and robs them eventually of their relationship with family and friends
it is a devastating disease which places huge burdens on families and carers who are often isolated and in poor health because of the burdens they face
as has already been mentioned in this house many of those who care are women
in the united kingdom by twenty fifty the number of those with dementia is estimated to soar to approximately one point seven million
the estimated cost of health and social care by twenty eighteen will be gbp twenty-seven billion
these are staggering figures which make research absolutely vital and the careful targeting of resources in medical and social care an absolute imperative
i also believe that we should recognise the contribution of the voluntary and community sector in this
commissioner you have made much of healthy and active ageing and i am proud to highlight the work of the mullen mews scheme in belfast which has driven off international competition to win awards for its social inclusion and improvement of the lives of those who live with dementia and their families and carers
