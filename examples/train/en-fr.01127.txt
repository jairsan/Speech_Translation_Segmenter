madam president today the eu commission is demanding of the irish government savage cuts in ireland's budget involving the slashing of public services and the living standards of working people possibly even for pensioners and the unemployed
the commission should know however that it is conspiring with the irish government in a lie to pretend that the money given to bail out the banks is not state aid while at the same time hammering the public sector
however irish workers and community activists are fighting back
tens of thousands marched in protest last friday thousands of workers marched in dublin today and on twenty-four november a public sector workers <unk> is scheduled in order to stop these attacks
in view of the seriousness of the situation that should now be upgraded to a twenty-four hour general strike to bring down this appalling government which has no mandate for these policies and to halt the policy of the commission and of the irish government to slash and burn the living standards and services of working people
