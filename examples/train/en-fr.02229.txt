i will provide succinct answers to both questions
the main objective of the cross-border cooperation programmes is to support the development of a common socio-economic environment for people communities and economies including the delivery of technical assistance
this should prepare countries to manage future cross-border programmes under the european territorial cooperation objectives of the european union structural funds
cross-border cooperation programmes between the western balkan countries also aim at overcoming the legacy of the past conflicts
cross-border programmes under the instrument for pre-accession assistance within the western balkans started in two thousand and seven
the results have so far been very positive
in the framework of their cross-border programmes both croatia and serbia showed readiness to cooperate in the areas lying on either side of the danube river
the annual allocation for the croatia-serbia cross-border programme amounts to eur one point eight million
this allocation of funds is used for providing grants to small joint projects proposed by local stakeholders in a variety of sectors such as the economy culture tourism the environment and social issues
project beneficiaries include municipalities ngos chambers of commerce or cultural institutions
large cross-border infrastructure projects such as the project referred to in the question are neither within the scope nor the objectives of the cross-border cooperation component of the instrument for pre-accession assistance
the commission might consider funding such projects under component one for serbia which is institution building and component three for croatia which falls under regional development if the respective authorities in croatia and serbia so request
as for the second question if i may continue
as mentioned in the written reply to a previous question by the honourable member numbered the european commission is aware of the deplorable incident in himarÃ« and is closely following developments
the alleged perpetrator has turned himself in to the police and is awaiting trial
the albanian authorities bear the full responsibility for the efficient investigation of the facts and the equitable trial of those responsible
the commission will be monitoring the processing of this case in conformity with the principles of human rights and the rule of law
in this question the honourable member also provides details of other incidents
albania and greece are closely linked by history
it is very much in the interests of both countries that they continue their cooperation and overcome any nationalist and extremist ideas which have been at the root of much misfortune suffered by the whole region in the past
the commission has repeatedly stressed the need for a strict enforcement of the rule of law and for full respect of human rights notably the protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities
all applicant countries are aware of the importance of fulfilling these criteria for progress towards the european union
in its recent opinion the commission commented positively on inter-ethnic relations in albania
however efforts are still needed to enforce respect for and protection of minorities
