madam president dr johnson was once asked what advice he would give to a young couple contemplating marriage
his reply was don t
he also described second marriages as the triumph of hope over experience
this report must elicit similar responses
what advice should be given to nations contemplating having their divorce laws made by the european union
the answer is obviously don t
to do so given all the precedents of incompetent and damaging eu legislation is surely the triumph of hope over experience to say the least
amazingly that also seems to be the conclusion of the council in this case
the council does not want the proposals made by the commission
the council seems to be very sensibly pulling back from the brink and listening to that old adage marry in haste repent at leisure
what fun it is going to be when the commission comes up with proposals to harmonise gay marriage and sharia law
