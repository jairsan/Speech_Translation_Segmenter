first of all as you know the provisions of the lisbon treaty were fully respected and i of course support the implementation of the treaties
we have to respect the rule of law in the european union
regarding the persons that were chosen honestly i think we have to respect them because minister van rompuy is prime minister of belgium and lady ashton is a member of the commission
so i believe they have the qualities to fulfil their responsibilities
regarding the institutions it is important to note that the president of the council has to be selected by the heads of state or government
it is not an election like that for the president of france or the president of portugal
it is the president of the european council and that president is selected by the heads of state or government
it is different from the president of the commission who was selected by the heads of state or government and elected by this parliament
so we have to respect the different logic of the different institutions
