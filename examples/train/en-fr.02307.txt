mr president this is not just a matter about hens in unsuitable cages but it is about the ability of the eu to oversee the single market
states were given ten years to comply by one january twenty twelve or the product would be illegal
the germans scandinavians dutch british and others have complied but certain large producers have simply refused
this involves massive capital costs and to comply means borrowing money
the regulation has put about fifteen pence on a dozen eggs
those bandits who do not comply might be given more time and would be clearly rewarded because they would have been given a price advantage
eggs from illegal cages will undercut those who obeyed the eu
one producer borrowed gbp ten million to comply with this directive
he did the right thing
is the commission going to renege and make his eggs uncompetitive
if more time is given then the moral of this story is that if the eu makes a directive it pays to ignore it
