mr president it would be a great mistake to place china in the same category in this debate today as we discussed iran
the eu enjoys a very good relationship with china and i think we have to take care that our discussions on the recent events in urumqi are accurate and based on fact
the incident that took place on five july involved a premeditated attack on the han chinese population of that city by the uighurs
as we know certain militants among the uighur population of xinjiang are islamic fundamentalists who demand a separate state
they mounted a violent attack that led to the deaths of one hundred and thirty-seven han chinese
so the vast majority of those killed were han chinese
the chinese government quite properly deployed police and military personnel to quell the violence and stop the retaliatory attacks by the han population on the uighurs
what else would anyone expect them to do
so let us base our criticism on facts and not take unfair records against the chinese
