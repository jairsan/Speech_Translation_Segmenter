madam president i would very much like to thank the committee on civil liberties justice and home affairs in general and specifically the rapporteur mr díaz de mera garcía consuegra and the shadow rapporteurs for the work done on this very important dossier and i welcome the agreement reached with the council
the suggested amendment will enable closer cooperation between frontex and the immigration liaison officers network and that will improve the information exchange via a web-based secure it platform and ensure that the council and parliament are properly informed about the activities of these networks
moreover i am also pleased that through the amendments put forward by parliament a human-rights based approach will be applied when reporting on the situation in matters related to irregular immigration in the selected third countries
let me say that i fully agree with the rapporteur that we should use the word irregular migration
unfortunately the treaty in article seventy-nine refers to illegal <unk> that is why it is in there but i myself also always use the term irregular migration so i fully agree with you
thanks to the amendments to the regulatory framework that you have introduced and in accordance with the stockholm programme the liaison officers networks will be adapted in a way that will improve their contribution to a better understanding of the root causes of migration movements with a view to addressing these phenomena properly
so i hope that when you vote tomorrow on the amended regulation it will be adopted without any delay and thus enable us to exploit more efficiently this very important cooperation tool for migration management
