unfortunately i do not have the specific information that the honourable member asked for in relation to the countries of the south
however i should say that the european research council bases its response to applications purely on excellence
it does not refer to which country which research centre none of those issues come into its response and its decision in relation to awarding grants
it looks at things purely from an excellence point of view
that is i feel the reason why they have gained such an internationally known reputation very quickly because it is recognised that their decisions are based purely on excellence
that is something we have to encourage and develop further
also the european research council should continue to further cooperate with european businesses
i should say that the european research council will launch next year a proof of concept funding option that has the objective of bridging the funding gap in the earliest stages of the innovation process where for example a potential commercial concept needs verification through testing or prototypes or indeed through the identification of an appropriate market or through the creation of a protectable intellectual property right
it is certainly very important to encourage the european research council to develop and to be this catalyst throughout the world
it is also interesting to see that a number of member states including in the south are now looking at the concept of the european research council in deciding that perhaps they themselves should look at establishing a research council within their own territory
