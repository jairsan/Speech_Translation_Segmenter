mr president if globalisation causes redundancies there will be a shortfall in revenue so the globalisation fund will not have the money it wants to spend
do not fight globalisation join it by encouraging competition within the eu and learn how to compete on world markets
you want to renew the social agenda via the working time directive which has two aims
firstly it was supposed to provide more jobs by limiting hours worked so that companies had to take on more staff but extra staff means the extra cost of social taxes so unit costs rise
small companies then become uncompetitive and lose orders causing short time or even closure
workers then have no job at all
how social is that
secondly it was meant to result in more time with the family but what use is that if the take-home wage is then insufficient
how social is it if the family is deprived of some of the nice things in life
let individuals work out their own salvation
many countries have a minimum wage structure and i support that
we do not wish to see the social ills of people exploited but the eu has now destroyed even that with one of its own institutions the ecj where the rulings on laval and other cases ruined member states minimum wage policies
how social is it to overturn the way national parliaments have tried to protect workers
these measures are nothing less than an attempt to establish a soviet-style command economy and we all know how well that worked
