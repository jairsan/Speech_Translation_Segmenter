madam president i am very pleased that this discussion is taking place today on an issue which has preoccupied many of us for a long time and especially since the sad events a year ago in tibet
therefore i think that it is very good that we are having this open discussion to again see what can be done
before i come to the many issues you raised in the tabled joint resolution let me also have a quick word on our bilateral relations with china
the eu policy vis-Ã -vis china is one of engagement
our strategic partnership is strong and this permits us to tackle all issues including the most sensitive ones
we have constructed an impressive framework of high-level interaction where we regularly address all the global changes that our citizens are facing without neglecting the issues where we may disagree
tibet is one of them
let me be very clear we do not see eye to eye with china on tibet and we still have a very real and legitimate concern about the human rights situation in tibet as you have both just outlined about the fact that tibet has remained largely closed for the international media for diplomats and for humanitarian organisations for almost a year now and about the stalemate in talks between the representatives of the dalai lama and the chinese authorities despite the three rounds of talks last year
these issues were also at the top of the agenda for several eu leaders in bilateral meetings held with the chinese leadership last year
we have endeavoured to find common understanding with china on this delicate subject and we have been very clear whenever we have addressed the situation in tibet with them
let me again mention the eu's position which does not leave any room for misinterpretation
firstly we support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of china including tibet
secondly we have always supported a peaceful reconciliation through dialogue between the chinese authorities and the dalai lama's representatives
i remember when i went there with the commission president barroso and other colleagues i had specific dialogues with many of my interlocutors on this issue
we have always maintained that there should be a reconciliation dialogue and that the dialogue should go on
this dialogue has to be constructive and substantive and of course we therefore regret that up to now this dialogue has not brought really substantive results
we have always said that the dialogues should address the core issues such as the preservation of tibet's unique culture religion and traditions as well as the need to achieve a system of meaningful autonomy for tibet within a chinese constitution
we have always said that this dialogue should address the participation of all tibetans in decision-making
therefore we would welcome it if these issues were to be addressed in china's future national human rights action plan
for us tibet is a human rights issue and has therefore invariably been approached as such
we have also consistently passed this message to our chinese counterparts and listened very carefully to their views
we have made every effort to understand the position in a spirit of mutual respect but human rights are universal and the situation in tibet is therefore rightly of international legitimate concern to the whole international community particularly the european union
this fact is of course emphasised by the existence of instruments of international law for the protection of human rights over half a century
in your resolution you stipulate the future of a sino-tibetan dialogue
as you all know at the last round of talks following the request of the chinese government the tibetan side submitted a memorandum on genuine autonomy for the future of tibet
in my opinion the paper contains some elements that could provide the basis for future talks
i am thinking of a paragraph on culture education and religion
i am also encouraged by the fact that for the first time in a written document the tibetan side has expressed its firm commitment not to seek separation or independence
i think this is important in order to bring this dialogue further
i am also pleased that the dalai reaffirmed before this house last december his devotion to the middle-way approach and to dialogue as the only means for achieving a mutually acceptable and lasting solution
let me conclude by sharing with you a personal conviction
throughout my political and personal career i have always strongly believed that through engagement and dialogue even the most difficult issues can be addressed and hopefully when the time is right can also be solved
therefore i wish to appeal to china and to the dalai lama's representative to resume this dialogue at the earliest possible opportunity with an open spirit and a view to achieving a durable solution in tibet
i can guarantee from our side our wholehearted support for such a process
this is our position and this is the position that we bring to the chinese side
