mr president burma is a country which is steeped in corruption
with two zero political prisoners under arrest access to free media impeded by the authorities and widespread slavery in industry the people of this country need serious help
however in spite of more than thirty-seven visits by un envoys in the past twenty years and six resolutions in this house there has been not a single reform made by the military junta
i would agree with mr matsakis that it is not good enough to point to burma we must point to burma's supporters and main supporter especially china its most powerful economic and military ally
yet a smiling mr sarkozy represented the european council at this summer's olympic games
did he press china's top officials who stood with him about the burmese about the sudanese about the people of tibet and about china's own persecuted people
i particularly also want to mention the misuse of aid funds that go into burma because we still try to reach the ordinary people of burma and yet these goods are often given to favourites of the burmese government to resell at high value
