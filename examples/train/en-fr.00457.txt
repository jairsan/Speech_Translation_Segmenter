mr president mr guardans camb√≥ and others such as mr karim and mrs mann have illustrated the gap between rhetoric and reality
we cannot even actually agree on what article twenty means
the minister speaking in english said that it was only an entitlement and not a right whereas mrs roure cited the french which says
but it is certainly in the charter of fundamental rights where it is enshrined as a right
we will surely not make progress unless it is legally confirmed that it is a right with binding eu decisions and common standards and the right to challenge a refusal of protection in the courts
the minister talked about co-location being under consideration of consular officials
my experience in the field of visa policy is that it is like pushing a boulder uphill trying to get member states to co-locate
commissioner verheugen referred to practical measures as being in development
but these were promised in the action plan in two thousand and seven a reference in passports posters a website in development
where are these
i searched consular protection on the europa website and found nothing
on the council travel website it says under construction which i think is a metaphor for the fact that we are failing our citizens in failing to put flesh on the bones of the promise of european citizenship
