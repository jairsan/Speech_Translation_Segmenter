madam president in recent years we have witnessed an ongoing campaign to suppress freedom of religious expression
christian nurses have been disciplined for offering to pray with patients and only today lillian ladele a christian registrar who was told to perform civil partnerships or face dismissal has lost her case for religious discrimination at the court of appeal in the united kingdom
equality laws have failed to protect christians indeed quite the opposite
an amendment to the equality bill to protect the religious liberty of churches was voted down in the house of commons two weeks ago amid accusations of interference from the eu commission
the commission in their reasoned opinion argued that the uk needs to narrow the religious liberty safeguard in its employment laws
i say shame on the commission
there must be a recognition that people have faith and have the right to express that faith
christians ought to be protected and not punished by the law
