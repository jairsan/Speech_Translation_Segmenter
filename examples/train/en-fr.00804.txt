madam president this report was about the rights of people with disabilities and i wanted to put on record and acknowledge the work done by richard howitt a labour member of this house in his fight for people with disabilities
i have always been a great fan of opening sporting opportunities for people with disabilities
we have all heard of the para-olympic movement but this year for the first time the european parliament and the commission are recognising the magnificent work done by the special olympics movement for people with intellectual disabilities run by mr tim shriver
this has programmes across the globe and one of them is now going to be part-funded by the european union budget
i have been privileged to go both summer world games in shanghai and this year's winter games in boise idaho and it is difficult to describe the range of emotions you feel when watching the athletes compete and participate
i just wanted to put on record my complete support for this resolution
