madam president across europe we are condemning generations of young people to emigration and poverty
we are condemning generations yet unborn and unbegot to debt all in order to sustain this conceit of monetary union
in ireland gdp is down twenty from its peak an almost incredible figure
in greece we have riots in protest against the austerity package and yet we know that it is not going to work
when the bail-out was agreed a year ago the idea was that it would be an immediate stop-gap that it would be a short-term contingent measure and that by now greece would be borrowing cheaply again as the crisis would have passed
we can see that it has failed
however we are continuing with the same policy in portugal and in greece again rather than admit our mistake
what a high price we expect our constituents to pay for our conceit
