mr president i supported the resolution and as one of the draftsmen of this document i would like to make a few points on the goldstone report the issue which is addressed in the resolution
the goldstone report has once again showed that investigations carried out by the warring parties themselves are hardly ever impartial and objective
the report is rather explicit that neither side has conducted adequate and effective investigations of alleged violations of the laws of war by its forces
also we should welcome the fact that the report has been revised recently and made less controversial with less bitter language and is therefore more acceptable
and the main lesson we should learn from this is that we should put effort into making the european union more involved in the process not only when it comes to the investigation of alleged crimes but in a pro-active preventive way as a party to the middle east quartet
