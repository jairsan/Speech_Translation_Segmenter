mr president last time some of us voiced our frustration over the mild tone of our public i repeat public pronouncements not activity on the events in egypt before mubarak's resignation
of course in her position lady ashton is caught between a rock and a hard place but if we want the eu's voice to be heard it must be loud enough to be heard
coming back to egypt based on my own experiences as a romanian i would expect the real difficulties to be only just starting
far from solving their concerns the departure of the former president will complicate and multiply the problems facing egyptian society
some of those problems like the army not fulfilling the promise to organise free elections at the set time or the denunciation of the treaty with israel will affect us directly
nevertheless i am encouraged by our willingness to try through constant contact with the local authorities to anticipate such problems and prepare to intervene with the most appropriate means
