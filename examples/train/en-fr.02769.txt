mr president as i may be the last speaker let me take this opportunity to thank your staff and the interpreters for your patience
please do not think it goes unnoticed or unappreciated
the european union is hungry and eager in its acquisition of all of the attributes and trappings of statehood
it has its own parliament its own currency its own president its own foreign minister its own external borders its own flag anthem passport and driving licence
it was only a matter of time before it would apply for formal recognition as a state in the united nations which of course is what has now happened with rather disgracefully and to me bafflingly the support of my own government
this is a legal regularisation of something that has been happening de facto for some time the pushing of the powers that we regard as definitive of statehood from national to brussels level
but the other member states of the european union should be wary of what they agree
one of the consequences of giving the eu full recognition of statehood is that they now can be addressed at length by baroness ashton and by mr van rompuy as respectively the foreign minister and the head of state of the new entity
and as members of this house i am sure will privately be able to let them know that is not an unmixed blessing
