mr president i voted against this report by mr carnero gonz√°lez which seeks to reintroduce more extensively in this parliament the european flag and the european anthem
in my country the people were told that the lisbon treaty was so different from the european constitution that it was no longer justified to have a referendum and yet the only substantive difference that i can find between the constitution and the lisbon treaty is the removal of these trappings of statehood
now this parliament is seeking to bring them back again
this illustrates the deceit on which the whole european project is based
it illustrates also the monumental contempt with which we in this house treat public opinion and treat the electors who voted us into this place
we must now have a referendum on the lisbon treaty in its entirety
