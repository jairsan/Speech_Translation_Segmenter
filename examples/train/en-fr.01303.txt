mr president i would like to congratulate the swedish presidency for the vision of a citizen-centred europe laid down in the stockholm programme
we can never underline enough the historic importance of finally having a vision that meets our citizens concerns for security and at the same time for respecting individual rights
finally we can move forward to a europe for the citizen by the citizen
i also would like to welcome the asylum support office which is an important and concrete step towards meeting the concerns of countries that want to fight illegal immigration while at the same time providing for a more humane migration policy
the stockholm programme will remain with us for five years and i hope we can move forward to implementation
i thank the swedish presidency
your footprint will remain with us for five years
