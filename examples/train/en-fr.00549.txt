mr president as a member of the committee on agriculture i will restrict my remarks to the impact of this proposal on the farming sector across the european union
i endorse the comments of other colleagues who have concerns about spreading the net and dragging farmers into the coverage as industrial polluters
agriculture must be monitored for its emissions but i do not accept that we should do it in this way
i would suggest that the nitrates directive in its current form does much of what we are talking about
perhaps we need to look at that directive which is causing problems in many member states at how it is being implemented and at whether it is being implemented effectively
in addition to that there are concerns about dragging in poultry in particular because that european sector is under huge threat from imports from third countries where no such restrictions apply
i would support amendments to the effect that this should not happen in the current proposals
likewise the inclusion of dairy farming is of concern and i would support colleagues in my own group and others who have tabled amendments to take these sectors out of the current proposal
i repeat my suggestion that when it comes to agriculture there is a myriad of directives covering emissions and pollution control in this sector and so maybe it is time we looked at recasting all of those so that farmers who are required to implement them can fully understand and appreciate what they are meant to do
it is one thing to draft legislation as we do in this house but we sometimes have no connection with how it is being implemented and by whom it is being implemented and whether that implementation is effective
