mr president i would like to thank mr cadec for his initiative
i very much welcome his ideas
i would like also to thank the members of the european parliament who have subscribed to this oral question
we are now working on the preparation of a maritime strategy for the atlantic
i would like to inform the house that i am determined to propose a well-targeted strategy in order to put maritime affairs at the top of the agenda in this area
i also recognise that this area brings a solid heritage of significant environmental importance and has many committed stakeholders
i have encouraged all those stakeholders including the atlantic coastal and maritime regions and economic sectors to give strong support to the strategy
they have already shown good support during its preparation phase
i will continue to encourage them to fully engage in its adoption procedure
this will be vital for the strategy's success
the public consultation has shown us that an atlantic identity does exist
it has also shown that stakeholders welcome an approach that takes into account their geographical demographic and economic specificities
they also support measures that bring coastal states together on matters such as marine knowledge maritime surveillance special planning and the marine strategy framework directive
the feedback we have received during the consultation will also allow us to identify priorities for eu actions in the field of regional development and research during the coming months
the atlantic strategy will establish concrete policy objectives by providing for cross-fertilisation between all the maritime sectors
a key priority will be to create jobs on the ground
this will require full commitment and active participation by member states the conference of peripheral maritime regions atlantic regions and the maritime industries
the assistance on these matters of members of the european parliament in their constituencies is therefore of the utmost importance and value
ladies and gentlemen to ensure maximum visibility i am proposing that we plan for adoption after the discussion on the reform of the common fisheries policy
in this way we will be sure that the initiative gets the appropriate exposure and we can also include the regional dimension of the new reformed common fisheries policy
parliament's position also has to be taken fully into account
i therefore believe that the atlantic strategy will help firstly to promote sustainable growth and jobs in the region through eu research programmes and regional development programmes secondly to achieve the objectives of the reformed common fisheries policy and thirdly to achieve progress in protecting the environment and at the same time to develop the maritime economy in a sustainable manner in this vital region
