madam president the irish pigmeat industry plays a vital role in the irish agri-foods sector
that industry is valued at approximately eur one billion and is responsible directly and indirectly for the employment of ten zero people
against the backdrop of the current economic climate and the rising cost of food prices it is critical that we do our utmost in ireland to defend the irish pigmeat sector which operates to the highest european union and international standards
the detection of dioxins above the minimum threshold in a sample of pork fat under the national residue monitoring programme enabled the source of the contamination to be quickly traced to an individual feed manufacturing plant
while any contamination of our food is always regrettable what this incident shows is the very high level of food safety controls which the irish authorities have in place to guarantee the integrity of the food chain
in other words those controls worked
i would therefore like to acknowledge the competence and swiftness of the action taken by the irish government and the department of agriculture regarding the decision taken for a total product recall
this was very well received by european and international markets and indeed by the european commission
it highlighted how seriously we as a country view food safety matters and helped maintain our reputation at home and abroad as a quality food-producing nation
irish consumers continued to buy pork as it became available on the supermarket shelves and there was an early resumption in trading in most european and international markets
obviously additional work needs to be carried out to resume full trading such as enhanced marketing campaigns and so on
i would like to commend the oireachtas agriculture committee for its comprehensive investigation of the dioxin incident which involved a series of hearings that involved government departments state agencies and representatives of the pork industry
i am glad also that the department of agriculture is carrying out a further investigation under the chairmanship of a very well-known individual in european circles professor patrick wall
