mr president the european union blue card is a much-appreciated initiative from the position of the developing countries
as the eu blue card will be issued by the member states one might speculate that a member state may far too often find after examination of its labour market that it is not in a situation which allows the facilitation of foreign labour or that a member state's public policy poses some obstacles to the full implementation of the eu blue card policy
i am afraid that some member states may undermine the purpose of the eu blue card
the eu blue card has not been created only to satisfy the labour demand of member states but also to start brain circulation
in a way it is a supportive measure to the eu development cooperation policy as the blue card workers eventually return to their countries of origin with the experience that is vital for progress
