the commission has strongly condemned the violence in gaza
this crisis proves once more that the israeli-palestinian conflict does not have a military solution
only negotiations with the full commitment of the parties can bring about a lasting solution
the commission welcomes the recent cessation of hostilities in gaza
it is vital that all parties make the current ceasefire permanent through the full implementation of un security council resolution eighteen sixty
a number of issues need to be addressed without delay in particular the reopening of all crossings into and out of gaza a sustained halt to rocket attacks against israel and an effective means to prevent arms-smuggling to gaza
now that the hostilities appear to have stopped it will be important to resume talks aimed at comprehensive peace as soon as possible
the eu has called on its partners for help in driving the peace process forward
the immediate priority for the commission is to alleviate the humanitarian suffering of the population in gaza
trading relations between the eu and israel will continue
isolation sanctions or any other forms of boycott would be harmful to talks and negotiations aimed at achieving a sustainable solution to the conflict
furthermore while targeting israeli interests they would also prove to be detrimental to the occupied palestinian territory which is economically dependent on israel as a main destination for its exports and employment of its labour force
