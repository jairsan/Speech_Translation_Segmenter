mr president i think that this has been an interesting debate and i wanted to just deal with the two specific issues that were raised in a sense outside of the debate before winding up on that matter
ms paulsen asked me whether we could find space in the i think the word was glittering new building to be able to have people working on the issues of concern in human rights
can i just say that i was delighted that madam hautala the chair of the subcommittee on human rights wrote to me to say that she was pleased with the design of how we plan to deal with human rights within the new organisation
however i am only moving people into one building to remove them from eight buildings where they are currently scattered around brussels believing as i do that enabling people to work together will make us more effective
we will have to squeeze them in because i am also trying to save money on the way
therefore i hope when you see what we do that the word glittering will be a nice word and not a word i fear that suggests i am trying to do something that i genuinely am not
in response to ms sinclaire the way that i was told to respond on human rights issues by parliament by decision of this house was to attend regularly the committee on foreign affairs afet to which the subcommittees of which the subcommittee on human rights is one would be invited and where they would be able to put questions to me
i have done that and i am more than happy to meet with ms hautala as i do and to respond to queries from her as well as to attend the plenary debates in this house
i am more than happy to try and do more i simply ask you to recognise that there is a limit to the amount of hours i have got in the day and the number of things i can do
but it is not out of any disrespect to the committee or indeed to you personally at all far from it
i do hope that you will feel able to contact my office with issues of concern and indeed to attend the meetings where i am able to come and speak
i am very well aware of my own background in terms of being a leader of a house of parliament and not being elected but i was very privileged to be elected by this house and of course to be invited into this role by twenty-seven heads of state and the president of the commission
as far as that goes i am very mindful of my responsibilities
in relation to the debate itself and the human rights issues that have in a sense dominated our debate i am trying to look at what more we can do
i will not comment on what currently is being dealt with specifically because i want to present this when we finish the work but we are talking to human rights activists and to organisations as well as considering across the twenty-seven member states what might be a more effective way of being able to address this issue and to put as much pressure as we possibly can
as regards mr karoubi and mr mousavi as i have said it is even difficult to establish precisely whether they are in prison or under house arrest
i am trying to continue to get that clarification
of course we are supporting the resolution in geneva for a special rapporteur on iran
we do raise these issues directly as well it is really important that we all stand together in pushing forward on human rights in iran
many honourable members have raised specific cases and the terrible record that this country has and we need to do as much as we possibly can and i think we can do better if we do that together
finally on the nuclear issue i spent four and a half days in direct discussions with the iranian negotiators and i am very clear in what i am trying to do which is to provide an opportunity for this country for iran to show what it keeps saying to demonstrate that it is moving in a civil nuclear power direction and not in a nuclear weapons direction
as i have said to them it is not difficult what they have to do is be open and transparent to allow the inspectors to do the job they are supposed to do and to do the confidence building that we have ofttimes explained to them in great detail
it is for them to choose
i am absolutely clear as well that the security council and my role with the e three three will continue to put pressure on to try and make sure this happens
what is really encouraging is that although i lead the negotiations i do so with the e three three sitting with me and that shows very clearly to iran that we are totally united in our approach and i pay tribute to all those who work with me
they have to show the political will to do what is necessary and if they do not i say to the honourable members we will have to do more to keep the pressure on
