thank you very much for that reply
i am sad as well that the conference is being held when we are in strasbourg
but can you make sure that on the agenda of that conference we do have the council of europe convention against trafficking highlighted
because there are a number of member states who still have not signed it and there are some member states including sweden of course that have not ratified it
so i think it is very important to make sure that it is high on the agenda at that conference so we can make anti-trafficking a reality
we have the wherewithal there
we really must act on it
