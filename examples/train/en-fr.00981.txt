madam president i think this is a very important subject that we are discussing here today
it is about european values
we put in the oral question and we have also drafted a joint resolution about the lithuanian law which is allegedly about the protection of minors
but it actually does the contrary because this law may well foster ignorance taboo and stigma
it will expose young and vulnerable gay lesbian and transgender people to bullying and exclusion
it will therefore lead to immeasurable distress and suffering by young people the very people that this law is designed to protect
instead of protection it inflicts harm on young people
therefore we have addressed this question and i am very happy that in the summer we received a letter from commissioner barrot expressing the european commission's concern about this law saying that the european commission will keep a very close eye on it and make sure that any national legislation is in line with european legislation and principles
i think that is very important because the european commission should not only intervene when market rules are being violated but also and in particular when european values are being violated
we cannot tolerate discrimination
europe is a community of values values which i know are shared by the majority of our lithuanian fellow citizens
we are all europeans
with reference to the resolution colleagues i would ask for your explicit support for the resolution and in particular for the amendment that seeks to insert a reference to the existing anti-discrimination directives because i think that is the very minimum
i also ask for your support for the request in the resolution to ask the fundamental rights agency for a legal opinion on this law
finally i think we can be proud as a european parliament if we adopt the resolution tomorrow to be the voice of the shared values of europe
