the word quota is mentioned in the question and i did not hear a response specifically to that question about quotas
secondly i would regret it if children were seen as a problem in relation to the participation of women in the workforce
children are children for a very short space of time and women can contribute at all age levels
so please do not just focus on children as a problem
the problem is not children in fact what is a problem is that we need more children in the european union
the problem is how do women break through the glass ceiling that the questioner has recognised
