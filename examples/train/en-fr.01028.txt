mr president i would like to draw your attention to the underhand and undemocratic way in which the incandescent light bulb has been banned across the european union
the initial directive handed implementing measures to the european commission which in effect meant that the regulation was allowed to pass without the consent of this farce of an assembly or of my real parliament at westminster
the ban was a stitch-up by the political elite and was done on a nod and a wink
the people have been bypassed but then the european union is very good at bypassing the people
just take a look at what has happened with the lisbon treaty
it was allowed to happen unfortunately with the collusion of the british conservative party who are the jekyll and hyde of british politics when it comes to the european issue
they say one thing in britain and they come out here and they do completely the opposite in committee
to conclude on the eve of world war i the british foreign secretary sir edward grey feared that the lights would go out all over europe
well done to the european union because with your obsession with the unscientific cult of man-made climate change what you are doing is proving sir edward's unfortunate prophecy to be correct
