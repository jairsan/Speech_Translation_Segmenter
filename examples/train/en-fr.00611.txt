mr president i rise in respect of the martens report because its title one year after lisbon gives me the opportunity to reflect on where we are one year after lisbon in the european union
where we are is in absolute chaos we cannot respond to the economic crisis there is a return to protectionism particularly by the government of france and there now has to be a recognition that the lisbon treaty is not merely wrong but is ineffective
we have listened or we should have listened to the people of ireland who made it perfectly clear in their referendum that they did not want this treaty
but if we did not listen before we should listen now
this is a treaty that is unloved unwanted and most importantly ineffective and this parliament should recognise the fact
