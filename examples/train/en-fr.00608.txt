mr president it is more than a month since you visited gaza but the latest figures from the israeli government show that nothing has changed still no materials for reconstruction are being allowed through the checkpoints no material for schools no material for industry
the bombing has stopped but the blockade continues
perhaps this would be a good time for this parliament to try and influence opinion by hosting an exhibition of the t-shirts to which reference has been made by another member clothing produced to the design of soldiers such as the sniper from the givati brigade whose design incorporates a pregnant palestinian woman and the slogan one shot two kills
there are other reports in israeli newspapers of other designs that are more racist more extreme more vile
such an exhibition might encourage members to question whether or not we should be continuing with the eu-israel association agreement in the present circumstances
