mr president the goldstone report was commissioned by the un human rights council which is inundated with israel's enemies so you could hardly have expected a balanced analysis
the us congress called the goldstone report irremediably biased and unworthy of further consideration or legitimacy
it fails to mention hamas terrorism and ignores the fact that israel is investigating one hundred and fifty allegations of misconduct by the idf and will prosecute wrongdoers
but behind the controversy about this report lies a human tragedy the tragedy of the palestinians who long for moderate and incorrupt leaders who will bring them peace security and prosperity through a settlement with israel
neither must we forget the tragedy of civilians in southern israel targeted relentlessly by hamas jihadi fanatics who hid in their schools or launched their deadly rockets
the ecr group continues to press for a two-state solution as the only way to bring about a long-term sustainable solution to the conflict in the middle east but the goldstone report does nothing to bring us any closer to that point
