mr president the motion for a resolution from the greens efa group calls for a new political approach at national and european level and for new ideas and firm action
we cannot overcome the economic social and climate crisis we face using the same policies and mindset that created them we cannot build a more democratic and more effective europe unless we do so within the real and changing political climate
today in wales the national assembly is starting the process for a referendum on more law-making powers
in catalonia in scotland in flanders and elsewhere there are changes taking place
tomorrow we discuss the enlargement of the eu to include countries currently outside its borders but we have not even begun to address internal enlargement the process whereby countries inside the eu's borders gain independence
these questions have not been answered in the debates on the election of the new commission despite the changes happening around us
i would ask president barroso once again to address those questions
