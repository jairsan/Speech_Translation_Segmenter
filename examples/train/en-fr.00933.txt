mr president as a new member of this parliament i believe that one of the major issues facing farmers in wales and the rest of the uk is the proposed electronic identification of sheep which will come into effect on one january twenty ten
the fact is that the scanning equipment to be used is not accurate
my understanding is that it is only seventy-nine accurate which will cause major problems for farmers throughout the uk
i urge the commission to rethink this policy and only bring it in on a voluntary basis
my fear is that many farmers will be penalised due to inaccurate equipment and that their single farm payments will be reduced
in the worst case scenarios the reduction could be one hundred
the concessions that have already been made are helpful but are not enough
i find it quite astonishing that the commission wants to bring in electronic identification eid with such huge flaws in the equipment
the sensible way forward would be for eid to be introduced only on a voluntary basis from next january
i urge members of this parliament to support me on this vital issue for the farming industry throughout europe
