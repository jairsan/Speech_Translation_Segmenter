mr president you might think that because i am leaving this parliament in july i should have no views at all on the programme for parliament in twenty ten
but i would be failing those who sent me here for the last ten years if i did not use this opportunity as a protest against holding this parliament in strasbourg at all
it is a scandalous waste of taxpayers resources
there is no reason for it there is an adequate parliament building in brussels
when i mention this to people in the united kingdom the expense and the trouble that everyone goes to to come here they are absolutely astounded particularly in a time of economic stringency that we should pursue the habit
the time has come to end the strasbourg farce to ensure parliament operates only in brussels and make a real contribution to saving public money for better reasons to spend it on
