madam president first of all i would like to congratulate the commission for its timely presentation of a very concrete action plan to empower european citizens
i have been very active in the discussions in parliament because i truly believe that the stockholm programme is the best way forward to a citizen-centred europe a europe for citizens with the people
i therefore invite the commission to stick to the vision of the stockholm programme when presenting the specific proposals for the next five years
the programme adopted represents a real balance between providing security to citizens while respecting their rights freedoms and integrity and strengthening their citizenship
on the action plan i particularly welcome the measures presented recently to combat trafficking in human beings and child abuse and to increase the protection of unaccompanied minors to mention just a few
i also welcome the fact that the action plan includes a strategy to combat female genital mutilation domestic violence and violence against women
i nevertheless wish that this proposal could have been presented earlier than scheduled madam commissioner
we also need to encourage the participation of citizens during the process and ensure the transparency of decision making and the openness of documents
i hope that the measures will be presented in a user friendly way
to conclude i look forward to continuing working with my colleagues in parliament and with the commission and the council to really deliver an area of freedom security and justice and make it a reality
