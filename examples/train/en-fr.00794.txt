i thank the presidency for that reply because it was indeed my understanding that the czech presidency was to take action in this matter
i am pleased to hear that it is being discussed within the council that you will take action to prevent poultry meat being frozen and subsequently sold as fresh because of course it means that many eu producers indeed all eu producers are not operating on a level playing field
so i suppose my question to the presidency is how soon can we expect some response from the council on this and can you give us any indication as to what particular actions you might take in this matter
