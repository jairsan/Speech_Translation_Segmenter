madam president it is a shame that mr barroso has fled the chamber
i feel he would have learned so much from me this evening i would counsel you all not to worry too much about the eu in twenty twenty because i rather fancy it will not be here it will go the same way as the soviet union which it so resembles and for the same reasons it is centralised it is corrupt it is undemocratic and it is incompetent it is driven by an unholy alliance of big business and fat-cat bureaucrats it is sponsored by an ecofascist agenda from a platform of perverted junk science referred to as climate change
whenever the people of europe get the chance of a referendum they reject it
the british of course have not been given the chance to have their say thanks to the deceit of the only three parties with access to television debate in my country aided and abetted by an eu-corrupted public-service broadcaster known as the bbc
the eu is already crumbling
the scenes in greece today will spread through the other mediterranean countries sooner than we can imagine and they will eventually reach northern european countries which are being left to pick up the tab
our children and our grandchildren will curse us as they are left to pick up the pieces of this wholly avoidable shambles
