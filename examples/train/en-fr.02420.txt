madam president the ecr welcomes the opportunity to discuss these issues in the chamber this evening
i would like to make it clear that our group believes that all three candidates for chairing the esa as presented to the committee on economic and monetary affairs yesterday are fully qualified and competent to fulfil the important roles involved
any comments i make this evening are purely about the process that has been followed to get to this point
i would ask therefore that future selection processes aim to recruit candidates from the broadest possible pool of talent in order to ensure independent thought and a new diversity in the senior management of such authorities
to that end salary scales need to be appropriate to the expected seniority of those roles
unnecessary age restrictions or any other criteria outside technical skills and competence should be avoided at all costs
we can do a little better than we have done this time in terms of the process and the transparency that could be applied with respect to parliament
i hope that note is taken of this in the future
