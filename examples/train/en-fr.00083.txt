mr president the commission greatly welcomes the general support from parliament for the commission's approach set out in its two thousand and seven communication a europe of results applying community law and thanks mrs geringer for her informative report
the commission attributes high importance to the correct application of community law
it figures in the priorities of the barroso commission and the commission is vigilant in exercising its role as guardian of the treaty
this is why the commission has made a major effort to improve its working methods for the benefit of citizens and businesses as explained in the two thousand and seven communication
these improvements include the introduction this year of more frequent decision-taking on infringement cases to avoid delays in the advancement of cases and the introduction of the eu pilot project in april this year
within fifteen member states this pilot project will test an improved method for problem solving and information provision to ensure quicker and better results for citizens and businesses
up-to-date factual information on the functioning of this eu pilot project will be sent to the rapporteur but a full report will only be possible as already promised after one year when sufficient experience will have been obtained for first conclusions to be drawn
we are also testing the use of officials in some representation offices in member states to follow up on questions relating to the application of community law to see how this might improve efficiency
this reflects the reality that all questions concerning the application of community law involve actions taken by member states
this work therefore requires the commission to work closely with member state authorities to try to find correct and quick solutions
a common interinstitutional understanding can also play a significant role in this important part of the better regulation agenda
it is in this context that i have offered to coordinate with the rapporteur future reviews of the application of the acquis in different areas to ensure up-to-date information
we are working to introduce the initiatives announced in the two thousand and seven communication on increased transparency
we are finalising this year's annual report in the form of a strategic evaluation of the current position prioritisation of issues and a programme of actions in order to feed interinstitutional discussion
in closing i would like to mention that mrs geringer's report also supports common contact points to guide citizens
i can confirm that the commission is already working to this end
we will come forward with our evaluation and suggestions as soon as possible
you attach particular importance mrs geringer to monitoring of the implementation of the directives on equal treatment
i can reassure you that a full assessment has been made of member state transposition
over forty infringement proceedings have been launched which are being actively pursued with a view to early results
