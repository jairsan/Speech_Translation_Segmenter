mr president i am disappointed that there has been a loosening of emission-reduction requirements in part of the climate package
the eu needs to set its course firmly towards a low-carbon future otherwise it will be overtaken by other countries that are now keen to make up for lost time
i think we may come to regret this missed opportunity to get our own house in order ahead of the rest of the world
but on the renewable energy directive parliament has succeeded in persuading member states to embrace the need for radical change in the way we source our energy
i want to thank claude turmes his determination made this successful outcome possible
for the renewable energy industry the directive offers legal certainty and the sweeping away of barriers to progress such as connection to the grid
on renewables in transport industry has been set stringent criteria for biofuels which i welcome
i am relieved that the final text protects land with high biodiversity and high carbon stock and that the requirement on greenhouse gas savings has been increased from the commission's original proposal of thirty-five up to sixty for new installations from twenty seventeen
crucially the effects of indirect land-use change will now be factored into the calculation on greenhouse gas savings and biofuels with no risk of side effects will receive a bonus
food price effects will be monitored and tackled through regular reporting and the twenty fourteen review
if parliament had had its way certain actions would have been stronger and more immediate
nevertheless this is a final text which deserves the support of this house
