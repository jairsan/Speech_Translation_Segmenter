madam president we have heard a lot this evening about the wonder of bees indeed they are truly wonderful creatures
i would just like to concentrate on one issue
is the commissioner aware of the interest and involvement that bees have sparked and inspired across europe
in the uk alone we have many prominent uk organisations with campaigns from the women's institute to the cooperative society
the information campaign is there
it just needs to be picked up on
please take a look at the women's institute campaign which i have sent you details of
it is full of practical information for anybody who wants to help bees thrive
the women's institute represents millions of ordinary people in the uk
the plight of the bee offers a possibly unique opportunity to work with citizens
it covers the common agricultural policy biodiversity food security pesticide use veterinary regulations and even the labyrinthine way of funding through the eu
it is a very unique opportunity to engage with organisations that are already inspired to work
i would ask the commissioner to take that opportunity and run with it
