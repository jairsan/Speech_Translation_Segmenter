mr president the central component of eu twenty twenty should not be stabilisation funds and bailouts
it should be a new strategy that all of our countries should want to follow to re-launch and re-energise the internal market of the eu
we need to be looking at how to change our economies so that they are fit for those challenges
the only way forward is to look at new industries via research development and innovation
the eu should be encouraging a new economic dynamism in the european research area creating networks for excellence research clusters for integrated projects based on innovation in new products and services looking at new processes and technologies and new business concepts
we should be looking at existing successful projects and using eu links to find best practice
in my own constituency i visited <unk> university which has fostered direct links with hi-tech firms in north wales achieving a ninety graduate placement even last year
it has not just improved the job prospects of the young people who attend but it has revitalised an entire region of north wales
instead of looking at the billion-dollar projects and silver-bullet solutions we need to get back to the nuts and bolts of what makes a successful economy
south wales has five significant pharmaceutical development companies with world-class technology
with a little eu assistance this hi-tech company cluster could be elevated to being a world-class centre lifting an entire economy that currently qualifies for cohesion funds into a brighter future
we need solutions to work effectively for our citizens
