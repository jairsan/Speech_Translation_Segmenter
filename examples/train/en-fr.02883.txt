mr president i too personally believe this whole debate needs a dose of common sense now
i still believe that some sort of european arrest warrant is a necessary tool to fight crime and terrorism across the union particularly given the huge free movement of people now moving between member states including sadly criminals
i also believe that the number of errors or miscarriages is relatively small but still too many
we must now not throw the baby out with the bathwater which is what some of the colleagues in this house would like
we need to seriously review the workings of the arrest warrant to include only a limited list of serious crimes always satisfying the condition of double criminality as being the only ones justiciable under the european arrest warrant
we must also respect fundamental human rights and include safeguards like
the large majority of uk-surrendered individuals were actually as it turned out migrants from other states of the european union charged with crimes normally major crimes not petty crimes
it is ironic that ukip which was opposed to their right to come to the uk in the first place is now trying to make it extremely difficult and expensive for the british taxpayer to send them back to their countries to face justice
