mr president i think my group will have no difficulty i hope in supporting my own report and certainly that of mr lópez-istúriz white
the report i want to address because it brings problems for members across this house is that of mr medina ortega
we all share the same idea we have freedom of movement of judgments
we would like freedom of movement of authentic acts and i add or equivalent documents
there has been much talk about facilitating the lives of our citizens
to me that means the lives of europe's citizens and it would not serve us well if a number of countries and a number of legal traditions were excluded from this area of justice
that is what will happen if we do not look more widely and have patience and tolerance for legal systems that on the face of it may appear different but if you dig deeper have very similar ways of approaching things
we have managed to recognise one another's documents
there is no earthly reason why with tolerance and care we cannot recognise one another's acts when they are done by contract or notarial act but not in exactly the same manner and form
my plea is please respect the amendments that have been put today
they may not be passed but the spirit of them is that this is a europe of justice for all citizens and all legal cultures
it should not become exclusive
