mr president last september i drew attention to how the electronic data of ships required in these reports could easily find their way to pirates operating off somalia
this was not heeded
these reports have been modified but not for the better
in fact there is now contradiction between them
i will try again
whilst mr sterckx obliges ports not to turn ships away mr savary says that they can deny entry if insurance certificates are not being provided
add the further contradiction of mrs vlasto which extends port control to ships anchored offshore
so if a vessel with no papers lies offshore and then due to extreme weather becomes at risk it must be allowed entry because mr sterckx established the right of ships in distress to a place of refuge
so we come to the situation of a vessel with a dangerous cargo finding its way into a port by manipulating these contradictions
what happens if it then results in a serious incident closing a major port
would the compensation mentioned in mr sterckx apply to all of that and in any case who pays
these reports need a real overhaul
finally the fernandes report endorses various imo recommendations
fine the uk has already signed these but the eu wants to add its own fleet database to which i and others would object
i say would because the fernandes report is to be adopted without a vote
how democratic is that
whatever happened to the comments made here this very morning that this is an amending house
