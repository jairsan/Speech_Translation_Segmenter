mr president and so the european union carries on acquiring one by one the attributes and trappings of nationality a legal system common external borders and now a common policy on who is allowed to cross those borders and settle within its territory
one by one it has taken on all of the characteristics that international law recognises as definitive of statehood
i wanted to compliment you mr president on your ruling that it was acceptable for meps to demonstrate as my neighbour did little tibetan flags on their desks
it stands in marked contrast to the way we had our placards snatched off us when we dared to display the word referendum in this chamber
i would like to ask you because i know you and other members of this house are interested in this subject to ponder the hypocrisy of being in favour of national self-determination in tibet but against national self-determination within the european union
if you think i am being extreme by drawing a parallel between an authoritarian state in china and the european union prove me wrong by putting your treaty to the people in the referendums that you promised
