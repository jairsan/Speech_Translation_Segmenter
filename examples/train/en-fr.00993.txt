mr president i have a small point of order
i note that once again we are not getting replies from the council to the questions that we put
i asked why the council waited for two years until the very last moment to decide on this deal and i would also like to know and we can get the answer in writing why the national parliaments have been completely excluded from the whole procedure
finally i read your answer which was fairly vague and seemed to be saying that you will not publish the legal opinion of the legal service of the council
