mr president a reliable and sustainable protein supply is really essential for the eu livestock sector
so i would like to thank rapporteur h√§usling and the members of the committee on agriculture for putting this important theme back on the agenda
your report is a welcome contribution to the discussion on the reform of the common agricultural policy towards twenty twenty
as you know the commission intends to table legal proposals in the autumn
i should like to underline that domestic production of protein has increased with a rise in by-products from biofuel production
production of rapeseed meal and ethanol co-products has risen sharply
they now represent twenty-two of the eu's consumption of protein-rich feed ingredients compared to twelve five years ago
support for farmers using crop rotation systems which include pulses is one of the main ideas in your report
as you know crop rotation is one of the elements under consideration for greening direct payments
so i welcome your support for enhancing the environmental sustainability of arable farming
i see further opportunities for exploring synergies with for example integrated pest management
however any greening of direct payments should not put in jeopardy the decoupling of direct support from the requirement to produce a specific crop
this idea is central to the market orientation that has been achieved by the past reforms
let me stress that several member states currently use the possibility to couple part of the direct aid to environment objectives to support protein crops
let me also underline that a significant increase in pulses and soya beans in the eu would probably imply a reduction in the production of cereals as availability of land in europe is limited
finally i would like to mention two other areas where eu policy can make a contribution research and rural development policy
both can play their part in getting the most out of our various sources of protein
for example they can help through useful training in the best use of protein crops and in optimal feeding practices
they can also help through the development of new plant varieties
in conclusion the commission welcomes your ideas in view of the preparation of the reformed proposals
however let us be clear
crop rotation or incentives through research and rural development policy can help
of course they can help
but the eu will remain dependent on imported protein
