madam president there is an ideology that is gaining ground in europe that teaches inequality between men and women
it says that women are of a lower status than men
it says that under inheritance law a man's portion must be double that of a woman
it says that in a court of law two female witnesses are required against the testimony of a single male witness
it says that in a rape trial it takes four male witnesses to convict a man but the testimony of a female is not accepted not even that of the raped woman
by the way the four witnesses must be muslims not non-muslims
you have guessed that i am speaking about sharia law
now apparently some muslims believe that suicide bombers are rewarded with seventy-two virgins in paradise but i cannot find any reference that female suicide bombers are rewarded with the male equivalent
surely this is a case of blatant gender discrimination
the british government has already officially recognised sharia law in some tribunals
while bigamy is still illegal in the uk polygamous islamic wives are officially recognised as dependants for the purposes of tax relief and benefits payments
europe is boldly marching backwards to sixth-century arabia
if we want genuine equality then individual european states must not recognise sharia law in any way shape or form
