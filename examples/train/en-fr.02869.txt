madam president i would just like to ask for a little clarification from colleagues on that side of the house because in the debate you have firmly insisted on the right of every member state to pass laws as it deems fit as long as it has a democratic majority and that those laws should be recognised by other countries
could i perhaps ask mr sz√°jer to reply on behalf of the epp group whether that means that from now on hungary and the other countries represented will also recognise the dutch marriage law that allows same-sex couples to get married
