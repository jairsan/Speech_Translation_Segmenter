mr president i am pleased to learn from the commissioner that screening the accession chapters relating to iceland which began in november of last year is expected to be completed shortly
of course iceland as a member of the eea has had a major advantage in that they have already adopted a significant part of the
i am also pleased to note from opinion polls in iceland that sixty-five of the icelandic people want the negotiations to continue
i will use my position as chair of the jpc to prevail upon the icelandic people not to take up entrenched positions until such time as they know exactly what the deal is later on this year
the second meeting of the eu-icelandic joint parliamentary committee will take place in reykjav√≠k on twenty-six and twenty-seven april
it was established last year and i genuinely believe that it is an important forum for dialogue and cooperation between the eu and the icelandic parliament
i have to say that i am disappointed that the coastal states did not reach an agreement in oslo at the beginning of march
it is essential that agreement be reached
we cannot fish one million tonnes of mackerel between the four coastal states while we are being told that the scientific advice is for only half of that
