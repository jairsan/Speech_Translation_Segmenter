mr president i welcome the fact that we are beginning our preparations for the twenty twelve budget so early
it allows for there to be proper consideration of the issues
one of the matters that we talk a great deal about in the european union and in this chamber is the issue of solidarity
we are often very keen to show solidarity for various groups of people
i would ask this parliament to show some solidarity with the taxpayers of our constituencies because we have so far failed to do that
in this age of austerity we need to show restraint
we should set an example
we should do so by freezing the salaries and allowances of all meps and officials in this place for twenty twelve and we should also abandon plans for the house of european history which will cost millions of euros to construct and for which there is no long-term plan to fund
no doubt that will fall on the taxpayer as well
