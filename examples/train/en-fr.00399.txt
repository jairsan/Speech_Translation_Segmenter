mr president it is fascinating as always
no sense of irony again in this chamber
one of the biggest problems that we have particularly in the united kingdom is the monstrously stupid avalanche of rules and regulations that came to slaughterhouses ten years ago which managed to close over one zero abattoirs in the united kingdom and gave rise to much longer journey times for animals
my brother-in-law is a butcher
he owns an abattoir in yorkshire and at one stage and this got into the magazine there was a visiting vet supervising a vet supervising a meat inspector supervising two slaughtermen that is the sort of nonsense that you get when you are dealing with this organisation's rules and regulations
the problem is journey times
now from bridlington in my constituency pigs sheep and cattle are being transported right the way across england to manchester because of all these closures of slaughterhouses
that is what we need to address
i am also talking about the transportation of horses
my colleague nigel farage tells me that there are countries in the european union which actually regard horses as food as an englishman i find it absolutely incredible that people would eat their horses
an englishman would no more eat his horse than he would his dog or his children but then i suppose that just shows the enormous cultural divide that there is between us and the other countries of this union
