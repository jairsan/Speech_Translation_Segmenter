mr president consumer protection we are all in favour of it
the difficulty is that some member states pay lip service to the solvit mechanism as other speakers have addressed
that needs to be looked at so that there is proper staffing
but can i tell you about some practical examples of consumer problems that come to my office
just this morning i had one relating to property transactions across the european union
i know the eu does not have competence in this area but could i ask member states where there are problems to deal with citizens as they would with their own and i do think there is an issue here that we need to take action on
the second one relates to business directories
european city guides has caused us enormous headaches in parliament and they continue to operate because they receive some level of protection within the member state where they are based
this needs to be addressed because the attitude of citizens to the internal market is affected by their experience in these areas even if there is not competence for the eu in them
