mr president i voted in favour of this resolution as it provides a balanced and realistic overview of the relations between the european union and belarus
president lukashenko seems to be seeking better relations with both the european union and the russian federation
the release of political prisoners a year ago was the first sign of the lukashenko regime's willingness to meet the demands of the eu and engage in serious dialogue
although the palliation of the regime's oppression can be considered an improvement a true regime transition has not started yet
i believe that the involvement of the democratic opposition in belarus as well as civil society is vital for a meaningful dialogue between the european union and belarus and eventually the key to the successful process of democratisation
