mr president on a point of order you very rightly say that we are here late and i thank the interpreters for staying behind
but it is not our choice to be here late it was a ruling by the presidency earlier today which was an unbelievably arbitrary ruling which has never happened before to put back the explanations of vote until after the debate instead of as we have in our rules of procedure after the vote has taken place
so it is because the president in the chair at the time broke our own rules of procedure that we are here tonight and all of us that are trying to make our explanations of vote are doing what we can legitimately do to raise our voices in a parliament that does not really like to listen to minorities
