madam president as chairman of the delegation for relations with canada it is with particular pleasure that i speak on this eu-canada agreement
i think it is very worthwhile reiterating some of the significant features of the agreement
as mentioned before in phase one airlines have unlimited freedom to operate direct services between any point in the eu and canada without limitation on the number of providers or indeed services
we move to phase three we will see investors able to set up new airlines in each other's countries and in phase four full cabotage rights and the potential for one hundred ownership of carriers
the agreement also sets out mutual standards for safety and security
and that is important because it means that the transfer of passengers luggage and cargo should benefit from a more streamlined approach
it is an important agreement for the eu and our aviation sector
it will allow increased competition greater choice for the travelling public
not only that i believe that the comprehensive nature of this agreement can serve as a benchmark for future agreements with other countries
this resolution clearly demonstrates canada's position as our most proactive international partner and i wholeheartedly support it
