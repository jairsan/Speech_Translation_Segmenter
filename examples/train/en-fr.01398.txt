madam president i come from the west midlands the home of the so-called tipton taliban who were detained at guant√°namo
as a ukip mep i must agree that seizure and deportation of people from one country to be tried in another without judicial oversight and to face foreign imprisonment is an alien process
it is an affront to liberty democracy accountability and natural human rights
i can give you a list of british citizens who have been forced into imprisonment in this way into squalid and unfit jails not at the hands of the cia and its rendition programme but at the hands of the eu member states under the european arrest warrant which this house created
it was made in the eu
so before you condemn the usa look in the mirror and see your own hypocrisy
