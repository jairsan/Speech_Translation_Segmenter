mr president the report describes turkey as having the sixth biggest economy in europe
well as a question of fact the total land area of the country that is turkey is over three hundred zero square miles and of that just three and a half percent less than ten zero square miles is actually in europe
only the eu could categorise turkey as a european country the eu has had this customs union with turkey since nineteen ninety-five
that is highly unusual
indeed monaco and andorra are the only other such countries
let me make a key point
the existence and indeed success of the customs union makes turkish membership of the eu leading to full political union with all the far-reaching consequences that follow therefrom wholly and totally unnecessary
that is something which will be argued about in europe for some time to come
