madam president a new opinion poll commissioned by the campaign for an independent britain has just been published
most of those surveyed said that the european union is out of touch corrupt and is poor value for money eighty-three of those polled want uk law to be paramount and therefore to revoke the supremacy of eu law and seventy-one want a referendum on continued british membership
unfortunately there is not much chance of that given that the labour government will not even give them a referendum on the lisbon treaty which it promised in its election manifesto
the british people want free trade friendship and cooperation with europe and the world not to be governed by the european union
if there were a genuinely fair referendum that asked the british people if they want ever-closer political and economic integration with the eu or to leave an overwhelming majority would vote to leave
