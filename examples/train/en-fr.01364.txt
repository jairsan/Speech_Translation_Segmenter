mr president i welcome the prime minister's very positive and ambitious programme for the spanish presidency
his emphasis on jobs and growth is vital to us all as we come out of the financial downturn and i very much look forward to working with a fellow socialist government
the next six months are crucial for the eu's economic and environmental future and we look forward to the february council for ambitious leadership in reforming the financial sector
in the wake of the failed climate change negotiations at copenhagen i am keen to hear how the presidency will work with the commission to put forward a common eu target for emissions reductions for the thirty-one january target
it has already been mentioned but i urge finally that during your presidency prime minister you will take the opportunity to resolve the issue of land grab and other issues which cause such distress and heartache to tens of thousands of law-abiding property owners across southern spain
we really do need action now
mr zapatero it is good to see you here and i wish you a very successful term in office
