mr president the g twenty came up with many sensible responses the need to rewrite financial regulation and supervision and the need to act in a coordinated fashion
our national politicians are saying one thing but here in the eu we seem to be doing another
the detail of the regulation that is already being considered by some of my colleagues shows divergence both in the timetable of implementation and in the detail of the regulation
our economies are still very fragile
unemployment is rising and access to finance is a huge concern especially for small and medium-sized businesses
do we want our british or european businesses to be at a competitive disadvantage when they need working capital
do we want to make it so expensive to borrow from a european bank that our customers our corporates just go and borrow from wall street and end up handing another coup to wall street at the expense of european banks
