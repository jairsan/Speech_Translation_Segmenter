madam president i should like to thank mr reynders and commissioner barnier very much for their support on the supervisory package which sometimes felt a bit like trying to push a boiled egg through a tea-strainer but finally we got through it
i hope our work on solvency ii and its implementing measures will be more productive and much faster
i trust that will be the case
there are many positives which have been pointed out already today and many negatives but i would like to agree with the progress that has already been made and what we should aim for
europe though and not just the eurozone it has to be said needs performance-enhancing regulations as well as safeguards
i have the feeling that nations are being made to feel like outcasts and this must be stopped
it is self-destructive for the eu as a whole
the international agenda is key
the european union has got to play a significant and crucial role in creating global standards
the problem is that if we believe that creating standards in europe alone is enough we will make a grave error
that is why i welcome commissioner barnier's remarks about table for the european union and the usa of comparative regulatory achievement
my office has already drawn up such a table
i would be very happy to share the contents of that with you commissioner
i hope it will be useful
finally i might ask where are we in dealing with the transatlantic economic council the higher-level regulatory dialogue
where do we expect to go in the future
we have problems before us we cannot solve on our own
