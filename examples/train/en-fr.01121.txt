madam president there is endless rhetoric here about friendship and cooperation between every state under the sun except for russia
china commits genocide in tibet
turkey denies its armenian holocaust
the usa flattens iraq and this place fawns on them
but for russia there are only pompous and hypocritical lectures
this confrontational russia phobia shamefully feeds the new cold war drive of america's warmongering neo-con lobby
of course there are some local differences between russia and her neighbours but can we not agree that next week's summit should be used to attempt to build bridges and cooperation between the eastern and western halves of our civilisation
for historical and cultural reasons this is far more practical and safer than attempting to create unity with turkey europe's ancient and eternal enemy
