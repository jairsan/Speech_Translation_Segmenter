mr president i am extremely concerned that the commission is adamant in continuing trade talks based on a mandate from nineteen ninety-nine which will undoubtedly have a negative impact on agriculture across the eu
sacrificing agriculture for gains in other areas is simply unacceptable
the beef industry in the united kingdom is currently experiencing a fall in farm-gate prices
if there is a rise in imports due to these talks i believe we will see an exodus of farmers from the industry
how is europe going to provide for these people
is it not unfair that our farmers have to compete with countries whose producers do not have to meet the same quality safety and traceability benchmarks as farmers within the european union
a commission that claims to act in the best interests of the citizens must do so
we must end these talks and look after our farmers
