mr president i support this report and in particular want to draw attention to three paragraphs that i think are really important given the rush to put older people into care rather than looking after them in the community or in their own homes
paragraphs seventeen nineteen and twenty-five are particularly encouraging in this regard
we need to make sure that there is a rights-based approach to the care of older people
we need to ensure that older people can live independently in their own homes and that there is support for them to do so
we should not allow profit to be made from older people being moved into the private care sector
i also want to draw attention to paragraph thirteen reconciling work and care
could i suggest to this house and to many parliaments across europe and indeed beyond that we need to look at reconciling political work with care
i would love to do a survey on how many people in this parliament have a caring role as well as a political one
few and far between
