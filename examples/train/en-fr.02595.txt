mr president i would also like to thank the commissioner
yesterday a new national government for recovery was voted into power in ireland
fine gael and labour are part of the ppe and s d groups respectively in this parliament
one of the issues high up on the agenda of the new programme for government will be the renegotiation of elements of the eu imf programme of support to ireland
at present many irish people fear that the conditions agreed by the then government in the eu imf programme of support are too stringent and place a heavy burden on ordinary citizens who have had to bear the brunt for the mistakes of the banks both irish and european and the government
we should note that the new government has agreed to reverse the reduction in the minimum wage
we know however that recovery cannot happen without pain
ireland went down a similar road in the nineteen eighties
many of the difficult conditions as laid out by the eu imf programme are necessary if we are to restore healthy public finances
we must prune the tree in order to allow growth
i welcome the commission's support for an interest rate reduction as stated by commissioner rehn
this should come about as soon as possible and i urge the commission to really look at this at an early date
the commissioner emphasised that all measures are weighed up against their effect on growth competitiveness and the sustainability of public finances in the long run
i accept that we cannot carry the entire burden we have been asked to carry at once
the irish people have taken their responsibilities in this matter in fact they have taken other people's responsibilities as well because we were given no alternative
what they have done is not just for ireland but also for europe and the eurozone in particular
we do not need the straw to break the camel's back
please give the irish people the tools we will do the job ourselves but please do not expect the irish people to carry a burden that they are not capable of carrying
so i ask the commissioner to bear those comments in mind in particular in the days and weeks ahead
