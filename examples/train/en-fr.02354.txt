madam president i welcome this healthcare directive but i am cautious because the devil will be in the detail
it is very important for our citizens to realise that this directive will not come into force for thirty months
but in the meantime citizens can cross borders to get healthcare in another member state and can be reimbursed for the care that they receive
so let there be no doubt that even as of today there are citizens who are travelling across borders for healthcare
that is very important
for those who want details on this complex directive i have spent some time writing a question-and-answer page which is available on my website
i urge those citizens who may be watching on the internet or elsewhere to take a look and if i have not asked the right questions to prompt me because we need to spread the word about this very positive move towards cross-border healthcare for all
