mr president education is one of the major factors that determines employability
the risk of being unemployed is forty lower for higher education graduates than for people with only secondary education
however youth unemployment and under-employment are unacceptably high today
too many graduates struggle to make the transition to the labour market and secure quality employment that corresponds to their educational background
of course the efforts to improve employability begin well before higher education
the commission works with member states to identify the skills or key competences that young people need to learn at school
today young people need a wider range of skills than ever before in order to flourish in a globalised economy
many will work in jobs that do not yet exist
many will need advanced linguistic intercultural and entrepreneurial skills
technology will continue to change the world in ways we cannot imagine so the ability to continue to learn and to innovate will become crucial factors for employability
guidance is also critical
young people are confronted with an increased number of educational choices
they need to be able to take informed decisions
this requires better information about education and training paths including a clear picture of job opportunities
we need to develop quality career guidance services and vocational orientation with the strong involvement of labour market institutions
turning to higher education the commission recently launched as you know youth on the move a europe twenty twenty flagship initiative which sets out to make education and training more relevant to young people's needs
we are now starting to implement the various parts of this strategy
later this year the commission plans to present a new communication on the modernisation of higher education
we will take stock of progress in making higher education more relevant to the needs of the knowledge-based society including the question of employability
we will identify the key challenges for the future and set out our response
as part of these efforts the commission will reinforce the european platform for dialogue between universities and business with a view to increasing the employability of students and to developing the role of education in the knowledge triangle
in a more global and mobile world transparency regarding the performance of higher education institutions can stimulate both competition and cooperation and be an incentive for further improvements and modernisation
however existing international rankings can give an incomplete picture of the performance of universities
this year the commission will present the results of a feasibility study to develop an alternative multi-dimensional ranking system which reflects the diversity of higher education institutions
europe needs to be better at anticipating the skill needs of tomorrow
this is why the commission has launched the agenda for new skills and jobs which goes hand in hand with our youth on the move initiative
the agenda for new skills and jobs looks at how to help our young people to become more employable
above all we need to give people the right mix of skills so that they can adapt to our fast-changing society
our new eu skills panorama which will be operational in twenty twelve will help to forecast not only the skills that employers need today but also those required in the future
in the spring of this year the commission intends to propose new european benchmarks on learning mobility and on the role of education in preparing people to be employable in the knowledge-based labour market
finally eu programmes to support education training and youth including mobility programmes such as erasmus can help young people to improve their chances in the labour market by gaining valuable international experience and by developing their intellectual understanding
