mr president of course this report about food prices fails to reflect the reality of the situation that food prices in the eu are kept artificially high by a brutal combination on the one hand of excessive eu bureaucracy and on the other hand by the now notorious common agricultural policy
farm subsidies ensure that inefficient farmers are bankrolled at the expense of the european taxpayer and at the same time of course ensure that the prices that we as consumers pay in shops and supermarkets for agricultural produce remain disproportionately high
the one thing that the commission could do to address the disproportionately high prices of food is to announce tomorrow that they are going to dismantle the common agricultural policy but of course they will not do that because certain member states particularly france benefit disproportionately from huge sums of taxpayers money being poured into an inefficient grossly disproportionate farming sector
that is the one thing the commission should do but of course they will not
