mr president the most important priority of any budget should be only to spend your own money
spending someone else's without their permission is not budgeting it is theft
british taxpayers are fleeced to the tune of gbp six point four billion in direct payments to the eu annually and we are still denied our referendum
taking that money without a democratic mandate is not a victimless crime
fifty thousand of our pensioners died of cold this winter because they could not afford to heat their own homes
our soldiers are killed by taliban bombs because we cannot afford blast-proof vehicles
thousands of cancer victims are denied expensive life-saving drugs
gbp six point four billion would right all those wrongs and still leave change to build eight new hospitals and fifty schools
there should be only one budget priority slash spending and stop robbing britain
our pensioners soldiers and cancer victims need the money more than the eu
to you it is a budget
to them it is a matter of life or death
