mr president we could certainly call the political situation in albania today a stalemate
sometimes calmer at other times violent this crisis has no end
last year this parliament adopted a resolution calling on all domestic political players to find a negotiated political solution to the crisis and to build a minimum national consensus
this resolution was ignored by the political forces and by the government especially
likewise the recommendations of the commission and of the council are being disregarded at this moment in time
it is inadmissible that exercising the right to rally and to protest in a country plagued by corruption be described as a coup d état
it is inadmissible that the credibility of the state institutions the presidency public attorney and others be undermined by statements by the head of government
it is inadmissible that those who shoot civilian demonstrators be called heroes of the nation and promised an amnesty
new local elections will take place soon
in the present circumstances they will be a political test for all political stakeholders
we ask commissioner füle and managing director lajčák to do their best in order to assure international assistance and international monitoring of these elections in such a way as to make sure that they will be free and fair or at least that we could assess their freedom and their fairness
we support the commission approach and that of commissioner füle in particular
we support the action by mr lajčák
we have to ask all political forces to bring this crisis to an end because the alternative is the isolation of albania and the jeopardising of its european perspectives
