madam president thank you for giving me the opportunity to explain the way i voted on this report
when i read the title of the report civil dialogue under the treaty of lisbon it reminded me of a phrase by mahatma gandhi
when he was asked about western civilisation he said that that would be a good idea
therefore when i read this title civil dialogue under the treaty of lisbon i thought that would be a good idea would it not
if only we had civil dialogue
if only we had two-way dialogue
one of the previous speakers said that dialogue is very much a two-way process but if we look at some of the civil society organisations being funded in order to promote the treaty of lisbon we only see organisations that are fully signed up to promoting this fundamentally undemocratic treaty
how many organisations that are against the treaty will be funded or will be allowed to be promoted
there is no two-way dialogue and that is why the citizens of the eu when they are given the chance and asked about the treaty of lisbon will choose to reject it
