mr president mr barroso said this morning that all member states had democratically ratified this treaty
that is not true
the british people have not had a say on this despite being promised it and until we get a referendum on this i will refuse to recognise the legitimacy of this treaty
now all eyes are on president klaus and what he may or may not do next week and it is interesting
i know that you all hate president klaus because he believes in national democracy
but what he is doing here is that he is standing up and defending the czech national interest
he fears german claims over sudeten properties and having listened to german politicians on this subject i think he is absolutely right to be fearful
so hang on president klaus if they do not give you what you want do not sign the thing
if they do give you what you want it will need to be reratified in twenty-five member states which will mean that the british will have a referendum and i am sure as democrats you would all like to see a british referendum on this treaty
i certainly would
and i wonder at the end of this summit are we really going to have a new european emperor
is it going to be tony blair with his empress cherie
well i have reached the conclusion that i want tony blair
please do appoint tony blair the man that gave away gbp two billion of the british rebate in return for nothing the man who promised us a referendum on the constitution and refused to give it to us
it is perfectly clear that in this european union the prize for national betrayal is a high one indeed
so please appoint tony blair
it will bring home the truth to the british people that it is not the elected representatives that matter in this european union it is people that give away national democracy in favour of the european union that win the top jobs
please please give us tony blair as the first president of europe
