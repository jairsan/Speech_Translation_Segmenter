mr president could i just thank james elles for his observations in relation to the comments made by mr bloom and suggest to my ukip colleagues that if they do want to make a point or have a disagreement with colleagues they do not need to insult us to make that point
mr bloom described members as eccentrics greenies and bored housewives i would suggest that he tells us what category he falls into
now to my more substantive point about the european investment bank
ireland has benefited through funding for smes but perhaps the president would comment or others may comment on how accessible that funding is because announcements are made and smes are enthused by these announcements but when they go to look for the credit line it can be extremely difficult to access it
i do think this is an issue of practical importance to the sme sector and i would like a response on this matter
