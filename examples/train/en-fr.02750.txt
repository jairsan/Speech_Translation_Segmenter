what the council conclusions gave us a mandate to do is to work towards the establishment of european civil protection capacity that is predictable and ready for immediate deployment based on our member states dedicating modules that we can mobilise and transport to where they are needed immediately as the disaster hits
where we are today is actually quite impressive because we already have one hundred and four modules that member states have registered with us and we have their commitment that we can mobilise and deliver assistance in a predictable manner as long as they do not need these modules to fight the same disasters at home
we still have work to do in identifying the gaps and how we are going to fill these gaps
for that we will do the prudent work and then come to our authorising environment to the council and to parliament for your approval of the approach we are proposing to fill gaps
what is advancing faster than anticipated last year is the creation of the european emergency response centre
i can assure you it would make a big difference because it would allow us to accelerate work on scenario planning what kinds of disasters we have to be prepared for and also on modelisation of the committed member states assets
the words that made a difference were voluntary commitment from member states
but once that commitment is made these assets belong to the community and they are deployable by us
