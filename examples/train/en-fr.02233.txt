mr president the subject of toy safety is important to all families across the european union
while it is a parent's duty to ensure the safety of the children they have responsibility for they need to be secure in the knowledge that the toys their children are playing with are safe
in fact i have brought some with me this evening just to remind us what some toys look like
therefore this easy-osy attitude to toy safety and the fact that we are here at eleven thirty at night to again ask questions about toy safety does not rest well with me
so what has to be done
i would like to know from the commission which companies directly selling or distributing toys have been successfully prosecuted for misusing the ce marking
on the subject of market surveillance owing to the austerity measures impacting on many member states it is the very organisations that are there to protect consumers which are disappearing merging with other cash-strapped organisations and having their funding withdrawn and their powers diminished
at a local level often the front line in the battle against unsafe toys budget cuts will impact on the effectiveness of trading standards
can the commission and council investigate whether these cuts will breach commitments made in the general product safety directive regarding effective resourcing and what monitoring is being applied to ensure that member states are protecting children from unsafe toys
to this end will the commission be bringing forward any legislation on the common european framework for market surveillance
as in the question tonight people have acknowledged the job of rapex
however it is resource-constrained and there is more that can be done to exchange information and withdraw dangerous products from the market as quickly as possible
what support is being given to the sharing of best practice between surveillance officers in the european union
in addition will the commission introduce a comprehensive eu-wide database on accident and injury introducing this in the first instance for children and toy-related harm so that unsafe products can be removed from the market as soon as is physically possible
i hope that in twenty eleven we will see improved commitment to tackling the problem of unsafe toys on the european market once and for all
