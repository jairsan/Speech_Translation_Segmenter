the protection of personal data is a fundamental right explicitly recognised by article eight of the european union charter of fundamental rights
thanks to the lisbon treaty we can now establish a comprehensive and coherent framework for the protection of personal data
this is essential to protect the privacy of our citizens to ensure a common approach to all data-processing activities within the european union and parliament will of course be fully involved in the reform of the current legal framework since the codecision procedure also applies to the former third-pillar areas
we must also ensure that the fundamental rights of european citizens continue to be protected when personal data leave the union
in this context a european union-united states agreement on personal data protection for persons could be important and we are working towards this
currently we are taking consultations to ensure transparency and collect the views of stakeholders and citizens
the commission plans to table a draft recommendation to authorise negotiations with the united states
