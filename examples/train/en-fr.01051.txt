i would like to thank graham watson for this very important question
in fact that is the core of the programme for the next five years to invest more in smart green growth sustainable growth
this is very important
we have to understand that the model of the future will not be like the model of the past
i am for a strong industrial base in europe but a strong industrial base for the new age of sustainability where we have to think about green development green technologies
that is where we can create new products new markets
this is a good example
that is why we are organising our future programme in terms of what i called in my political guidelines new sources of growth because with the traditional sources of growth we will not win the battle of competitiveness with big emerging economies like china and india
so innovation has to be at the core at the centre of our agenda for growth new sources of growth promoting the transition to a low-carbon economy smart green development and innovation
i think innovation will be key for the development of the european economy in the future
