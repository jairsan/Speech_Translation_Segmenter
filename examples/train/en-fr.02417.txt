madam president this moment has been a long time coming
it is being led by both the old and by those who have known nothing other than mubarak in egypt
our response has been to say that egypt should not be destabilised any further than it is that the people of egypt be delivered a government of their choice through their free will
well that is right but it is not enough
and then from the floor of the house today i hear warnings of an islamic tsunami that is waiting to come and destroy us all
all you do by putting forward those arguments i am afraid is argue for a totalitarian regime thinly disguised by a very thin layer of democracy and you do not place any value on those people who have paid with blood and paid with their lives both in tunisia and egypt
they paid with their lives fighting for the freedom of their countrymen and they will not value your freedom any less
those on the streets despite being very large in number are a vocal minority who actually represent an even larger silent majority
high representative this is not a time for limp wrists
have strength in your stride send a clear message mubarak must go now
