mr president the eu's social protection and social inclusion process is core to ensuring the achievement of the european union's strategic goal of sustained economic growth more and better jobs and greater social cohesion
during an economic crisis there are increased risks of poverty and social exclusion for many citizens but particularly for those on the margins of society for those who become unemployed and for those who rely on the various social safety nets that operate within the different member states
this question asks the commission if it is attempting to mainstream the social protection and inclusion process in the provision of medium-term financial assistance for member states balances of payments under council regulation ec no three hundred and thirty-two two thousand and two
i am always sensitive to the imposition of too many conditions and excessive red tape on recipients of assistance and that goes for member states right down to smes and individuals
however when that imposition would help to realise a core eu principle such as social inclusion then it is indeed important
we cannot aspire to a social inclusion process and produce lots and lots of documents outlining how to achieve it if at the same time we do not ensure that this process is mainstreamed in our initiatives
the commissioner says that we have attached harsh conditions to these loans but i was not exactly clear as to what these conditions are and indeed if they include social conditionality
regardless of the circumstances whereby eu funds are disbursed we cannot wash our hands and hope for the best
we have been asked to trust member states
trusting member states is fine but trust has always to be earned and if there are concerns i believe they need to be dealt with
