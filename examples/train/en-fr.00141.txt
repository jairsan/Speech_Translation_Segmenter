madam president for a number of years i have been concerned that current legislation on timeshares did not take into account the range of new products in this area coming on to the market
therefore i welcome the revisions being made in this proposal
extending the scope to cover holiday clubs and other similar products is a great step forward in protecting the consumer from what had previously been an easy target for the unscrupulous tout
this directive certainly shows that the eu is taking steps to stay ahead of the game
i have to admit however that i am disappointed that parliament had to give way on a provision calling for cooling-off periods of twenty-one days in order to reach agreement with the council
however this is not to say that the improvements made have had no effect on the current directive and in fact it is to be welcomed that no upfront payments have to be made until the end of the cooling-off period
a great deal of effort has gone into reaching this compromise with the council and i hope to see the report adopted today with a large majority
