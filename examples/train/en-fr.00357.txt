mr president i am opposed to this report because of the threat which i perceive it poses to governments and firms that have invested hugely in defence r d and which now find themselves robbed of return through the development and production phase
under this proposed directive procurement contracts are now required to be opened up to european competition leaving a defence company even a country with no means of protecting its international property rights and jobs
given that several military defence companies in the united kingdom have leading-edge r d the threat of this report is a major concern
my unease is heightened by the recognition that a driving motivation in this report is to bolster eu integration and the european security and defence policy rather than prioritising tangible economic benefit
