mr president recent events in bishkek are alarming and a sad end to the two thousand and five tulip revolution or colour revolution when president bakiyev had promised democracy and human rights and instead delivered corruption nepotism and increasing autocracy
kyrgyzstan remains the smallest and poorest country in central asia and has undergone a worrying infiltration of radical islamists in the fergana valley in recent years so stability must be the eu's priority for the region
it is right and proper now to recognise the new otunbayeva government an unusual example where we have a common interest with that of russia which actually supported the revolution and overthrow of the bakiyev regime
president roza otunbayeva served briefly as ambassador to the united kingdom so she knows the workings of the european union well
lastly central asia is a strategic region for reasons of energy and global security and the operational capability of the us air base in kyrgyzstan is vitally important to support isaf in afghanistan as well
