mr president lest we forget that there are people affected by these problems i met a young irishman on the flight to frankfurt today on his way to australia with a one-way ticket and he is just one of thousands who are doing this because of our economic and banking problems
would the commission accept that the damage done to europe's credibility by the fudging of the first banking stress tests and i say this with great regret is almost irreparable
european union citizens are looking on in distress at what has happened in relation to banking
we have damaged confidence in the european union and in the eurozone
as you know the irish banking sector has had its second round of stress tests and the new government has put in place a restructuring plan
the additional capital required was eur twenty-four billion
the impact on the irish economy now is that good enterprises are starved of capital as banks struggle to meet the various requirements
this is an impossible scenario and i would ask the commissioner to address it
