madam president i welcome the fact that this report looks at what can be done at european level to stimulate the economies whilst i recognise that most of the instruments to do so remain at national level ninety-nine of public expenditure is national not european most regulation is national not european
but if we look at what we can do at european level the plan proposed by the commission for a eur thirty billion contribution including advance payments from structural funds and new loans from the european investment bank can and will make a real contribution to coming out of this crisis
we must also make sure that we avoid protectionism in europe
a beggar-your-neighbour approach by different countries would weaken our common market and seriously damage the prospects of job creation and economic growth in the long term
on the contrary freedom of movement for workers and initiatives to help businesses exports to the single market will help provide the stimulus needed for our economic recovery
