madam president for the new commission and i warmly welcome commissioner f√ºle now is the time to renew the eu's commitment to enlargement by completing accession negotiations with croatia by the end of this year and starting negotiations with macedonia
the latter has made impressive progress despite manifold difficulties and should be encouraged to continue
i would like to invite both parties to solve the name issue in an open and generous european style as advocated yesterday by president barroso
turkey too has made significant progress
if we look at ukraine we can realise the difference that the very prospect of accession can make
turkey is welcome to membership on the basis of meeting the copenhagen criteria
with a new commissioner there is no time to be lost in making turkey start pulling its troops out of cyprus and implementing the ankara protocol
i think this could be seen as a condition for proceeding with negotiations
as for myself i could feel comfortable with turkish accession when it is as easy to build a christian church in ankara as it is to erect a mosque in brussels
