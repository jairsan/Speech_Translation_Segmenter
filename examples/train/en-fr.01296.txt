let me underline that it is not a lack of political will
we do understand the importance of this directive and we have been working really really hard to get it into place
but as i have said i cannot change the fact that we need unanimity and the unanimity is not there
the swedish presidency and presidencies before us have worked to try to propose different compromises different ways forward
there are lots of working groups meeting and working all the time and they still are meeting
we will work on the issue until the end of our presidency
but unfortunately we do not have the unanimity yet
it would be unfortunate to separate the different parts of the directive because the whole purpose and this was very much also encouraged by parliament was to have a comprehensive directive on discrimination
if we start to pick up pieces i think that thought would be lost and i think it would be deplorable
so let us try a little bit more to get the whole directive into place because that would be very valuable in the fight against discrimination for disabled people but also for other discriminated people all around europe
