mr president each year the conference of presidents tables different amendments to try to ensure that we spend more time in strasbourg than we should
in fact we spend more time in strasbourg than anybody out there really appreciates because just getting to this place involves almost a day of travel for most people
we should not be choosing to come to strasbourg at all
the one extra right i would like this parliament to have is the right to choose where it sits
my colleague mr posselt recognises there is some local advantage to politicians who live close to this place
however it is not easy for all of us just to commute across the border from germany
to get constituents here people who want to visit to see how this parliament works it takes over a day
we have perfectly good facilities in brussels
we should not be voting to extend the time we spend in strasbourg we should be voting to get rid of it
