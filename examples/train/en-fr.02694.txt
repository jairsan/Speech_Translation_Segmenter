mr president i would like to thank the rapporteur
the motion for a resolution before us is balanced and covers all key aspects of the progress report
with thirty-three chapters discussed in the progress report iceland moves forward quickly to meeting the criteria to join the eu
the reference in the motion to the report of the special investigation committee into the collapse of the icelandic banking system is important
the fact that justice will be served on the culprits of the crisis is welcome
perhaps the eu and its member states could copy iceland's sensible approach
however there are two issues i wish to raise this evening icesave and mackerel
the referendum at the end of this week will hopefully bring an end to the saga
however i was disappointed that the second referendum was necessary after the intense renegotiation and the approval of the althingi the icelandic parliament
on mackerel the unilateral increase of quotas without discussion and the consequences for neighbouring fleets was short-sighted
the need to resolve issues surrounding fisheries is essential to the success of the accession negotiations
finally i would like to wish the second jpc led by pat the cope gallagher to reykjav√≠k on twenty-six and twenty-seven april well
