madam president i strongly support the elaboration of this eu strategy for the danube region
historically the river danube has connected western and eastern europe and belonging to the danube region has evolved a sense of community among people
we can say that this facilitated cultural and economic cooperation long before the idea of european integration was born
this strategy is an opportunity to put into practice the valuable principles of solidarity and cooperation
the document should be based on a bottom-up approach as some colleagues including mrs hyusmenova have already pointed out
its priorities should come from the danube municipalities districts and cities and it is very important that regional authorities and civil society recognise the strategy as their tool for better cooperation and coordination
so real ownership of the process is needed here
the danube countries face similar environmental and infrastructural problems
they aim at strong socio-economic development and endeavour to have higher living standards for their citizens
i am convinced that the danube strategy will contribute to achieving these aims and resolve common problems by more effective and efficient use of available funds that it will facilitate the realisation of common projects and that european citizens will then benefit from its results
i agree also that a common approach which does not have too many priorities is needed
the danube strategy will be an excellent instrument to considerably enhance cross-border cooperation in this region and i strongly believe and hope that the commission will do its best to fully support its implementation including by allocating additional financial resources
