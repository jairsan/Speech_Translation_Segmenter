mr president honourable members i have found the debate interesting and inspiring
like most of you i am persuaded that our efforts to combat tax fraud and evasion and to increase tax cooperation are worthwhile
i am grateful for your support and for the work of the four rapporteurs and i am very grateful for the support for these important commission initiatives
promoting good governance in tax matters is a complicated dossier containing several different issues
your reports have covered virtually all of them from the formal legislative proposal promoting administrative cooperation to our work with third countries
i was pleased to hear that many of you encouraged the commission to be more ambitious
i fully agree with you and i am sure that with your support and with that of the governments of the member states the new commission will be able to tackle the challenges ahead
i know that these files remain a priority for my successor
the commission parliament and the council should continue efforts for the approval of the legislative proposals which are on the table or in the pipeline and the work of the code of conduct group on business taxation
on the external aspects of the principles of good governance in tax matters all actions mentioned in the communication should be promoted with special attention to those related to developing countries
as regards the specific proposals on administrative cooperation mutual assistance in the recovery of tax claims and the optional and temporary reapplication of the reverse charge mechanism i also want to thank you for your comments and views
i am glad to see that the european parliament and the commission share views on the action to be undertaken to better combat tax fraud and evasion in the european union and beyond
i also see general support for the three proposals
achieving rapid progress and unanimous agreement on the proposal on administrative cooperation is one of the priorities of the spanish presidency
it is also now a priority for most member states
the eu urgently needs to reach a unanimous agreement internally to be able to show on the international scene its determination to move ahead from the oecd standard and the g twenty recommendations and pave the way for a future evolution at international level by proving it is able to develop fully fledged administrative cooperation
it is clear that there is no one single and global solution for eliminating tax fraud and evasion but the proposals we have discussed today are important steps forward within the framework of the european union's anti-tax fraud strategy
finally just one day before the end of the mandate i would like to repeat my thanks for the support for the commission's tax and customs initiatives and in particular for the cooperation of the econ and imco committees
