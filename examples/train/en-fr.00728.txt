madam president i would like to thank mrs morgan for her report on the electricity markets
as a shadow rapporteur it has been a pleasure to work together with her and i think it is fair to say that we have been able to achieve a liberalisation of the energy markets
at least we have made some important steps and thereby we have opened up the market
i think it is fair to say that the report on electricity also played the lead in the process that we are discussing here today
i think it is important to state that this is also in contrast to those in different countries who would like to have more protected borders regarding energy markets
we have a debate in sweden in which there are those who would like to have some sort of protectionism regarding the export of electricity
but that would hinder and damage all the things that we can achieve by an open electricity market
it is by opening up the markets that we can do something about climate change and can make the best use of renewables and nuclear power
we can also ensure that we have a good supply of energy all over the union binding countries and markets together
i think the steps we are taking with this energy market package should be seen as important ones
although there are more steps to be taken we have contributed to the energy security of europe and to the fight against climate change
