mr president the eu has been asking for the closure of guant√°namo for a long time
today that decision has been taken by the new us administration and eu countries are expected to show solidarity by taking over those prisoners
however some think that such solidarity should be demonstrated primarily by the countries mentioned before in the press as hosting secret cia detention centres
i would like to stress once more the fact that such allegations have not been supported by evidence either when they were made or since then
that is also valid for mr mate who failed to produce the evidence supporting his accusations in this very house
moreover internal investigations have not supported the accusations either
exploiting people's potential lack of memory that such evidence was not produced then does not make it evidence today
at the most it is simply cynical manipulation for obscure purposes
