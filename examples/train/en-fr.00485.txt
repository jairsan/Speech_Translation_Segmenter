madam president nato is the backbone of european defence and we rely on nato forces for the security of our union
but nato forces in cyprus turkish nato forces are not a force of freedom but one of occupation occupation of eu territory
not only did these turkish forces cause death and destruction on the island when turkey invaded in nineteen seventy-four but they today continue to keep an eu member state divided causing fear and oppression among both greek and turkish cypriots and obstructing the current negotiations between the two community leaders on the island
so in discussing nato's important role in european defence it is fair to remember that the eu has not yet put the necessary pressure on turkey to get its nato invasion army out of cyprus unconditionally and immediately
do you not agree with me mr solana
perhaps he is not listening
do you not agree that the turkish army should leave cyprus immediately mr solana
