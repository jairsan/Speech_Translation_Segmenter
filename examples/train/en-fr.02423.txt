madam president this banana is the stuff of war an eu-inspired trade war with america that has lasted sixteen years and has now been lost spectacularly
the eu has now been fined nearly usd two hundred million by the world trade organisation and been forced to drop its illegal tariffs all because of the protectionism that lies at the heart of the eu in this case protection of french colonies
may i say that this very banana which i bought today in the european parliament supermarket is illegal it does not conform to eu rules in terms of the length the width and the straightness of bananas
what is going on
with such barmy protectionism and such silly rules as this one has to ask is the european union crazy or has it merely gone bananas
