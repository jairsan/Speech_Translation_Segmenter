madam president this is a dreadful piece of legislation
it is dreadful because it criminalises the employer and does not criminalise the illicit immigrant
it is nonsense
this will create a sense of foreboding among all employers whenever they have to employ somebody
can you imagine what will happen when a potential employer looks at a potential employee and starts asking questions which are of a very intrusive nature
in addition this has nothing at all to do with the european union
this ought to be a matter for national legislation and national governments for the national parliaments of individual member states to decide whom they want and do not want in their countries
to criminalise national employers at a time of deepening recession is absurd
this piece of legislation should never see the light of day
