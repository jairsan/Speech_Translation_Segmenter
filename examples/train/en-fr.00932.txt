mr president we will not overcome the deep financial economic and jobs crisis or climate change as independent protectionist nation states
without europe and the euro we are sunk as a continent but neither can we continue as a union as though nothing was wrong except a few greedy bankers budgeting discipline will not solve the problem
the system is broken and must be deeply reformed
already the financial institutions are resisting the regulations we need to prevent a future meltdown
we need more integration of our social and economic and climate and energy policies with the objective of job retention and creation with decent living and working conditions
we need a breakthrough in the climate change summit in december
we need more than ever now a recommitment to the millennium development goals and more immediately mr president-in-office i regret you did not call for an immediate lifting of the siege of gaza or indicate any wish to re-energise the search for peace alongside president obama
as a member from ireland i would like to remind the house that political irony is a trait much appreciated in ireland
jonathan swift the author of once proposed to the british government that the way of solving poverty in ireland was to encourage us to eat our babies
well i do not think the historical irony of the united kingdom independence party proposing to come to ireland to campaign for the independence of the united kingdom from the european union will be lost on the people of ireland as a subject for a good belly laugh
it will be something to see mr nigel farage dressed in his union jack and leprechaun hat arm in arm with gerry adams the former leader of the ira and joe higgins my colleague up here in the back calling for a no vote on the lisbon treaty each with their own lemming-like contradictory agendas
i am confident the irish people will tell this particular circus what they told libertas get lost
