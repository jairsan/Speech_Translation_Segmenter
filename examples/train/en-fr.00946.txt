mr president i was listening to this debate in my office
obviously and thankfully in ireland we do not experience the severity of the fires that our southern european colleagues do
two thoughts struck me
one is that in this house we tend to speak only on those issues that directly affect our own countries and given that we are having a debate in ireland on the lisbon treaty where we are talking about solidarity across the european union i think it is a habit we should break
i think more of us should speak about issues of concern in other member states that we know of so that there is a sense in which there is greater solidarity among members of this house regarding the concerns of their citizens
i would for example like other people to take up concerns that might arise in ireland for my citizens
i think it would help us to promote the idea that europe works for all and that we are not just looking after our own
that has been one of the failures of the european union and it is something we are grappling with in the debate on the lisbon treaty
let me support what you are doing here and express my solidarity for the problems in southern europe
deal with those who deliberately destroy
look at prevention
much more must be done by management and lastly the solidarity funds should be released to those who need them
