mr president uganda is a deeply christian country where traditional values hold sway
homosexuality is illegal in uganda as it is in many african countries
we must of course be sensitive about forcing our more liberal and tolerant values on others because it can sometimes be counterproductive
but we should not be afraid to speak out against this outrageous bill because it is clearly a draconian and hugely disproportionate piece of legislation
it would not only be seriously detrimental to the safety and freedom of homosexuals in uganda but it would also tarnish the image of uganda throughout the world and make it into a pariah
uganda has made many great strides in the past two decades and in some ways can be seen as a model for africa's development
why should uganda's parliamentarians choose to throw all that goodwill away
why should they seek to place their country alongside brutal iran which regularly executes homosexuals in public
let us hope that through our mutual outrage in this house and in many other parliaments throughout the world at this piece of brutal legislation we can convince the ugandan president to veto it
