mr president i just wish in particular to congratulate all my colleagues on the committee on the internal market and consumer protection who worked on the future of the internal market scoreboard
it is an issue that is close to my heart as it provides an excellent communication tool for how member states treat eu directives
it is also close to my heart because i am constantly hearing about overzealous eu regulation particularly in my home country ireland and this needs to be digested
well a quick glance at the scoreboard will show you that ireland has misapplied eu directives on no less than sixty-seven occasions and is in danger of missing out on the one transposition deficit target as agreed
this raises the question who is at fault for this supposedly overzealous regulation
if a member state is not transposing eu legislation correctly or is adding more regulation onto directives then is it the fault of the eu or the member state
i think possibly and probably the latter
perhaps an idea for the scoreboard in future might be to directly address the matter of overregulation or gold plating as it is known
i think this would be a positive outcome
