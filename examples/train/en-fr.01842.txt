mr president i fully support efforts to make the activities of sports agents mainly in football more transparent and i believe that the eu should be supporting the various sporting governing bodies to ensure that they can do just that
we need to shine a light into the murky world where exploitation could be rife and matters such as dual representation whereby the agent can be representing a player at the same club that is trying to sign the player need to be looked at
however any legislation that comes forward to regulate this sector must be from the national sporting bodies or authorities such as fifa and uefa
it is really not the place of the eu to be regulating in the sporting world especially with the global nature of this particular problem
where we can add value to sports we should but we should only intervene upon the request of the sporting governing bodies where we can clearly deliver value or give clarity
