mr president i think we all know that this year's budget and trilogue are going to be difficult
therefore as a parliament we need to be clear on what our priorities are and be prepared to fight for them
in other words we should be prepared to look at reallocating resources to our priorities
in my view our priorities should be policies which promote jobs and growth across the eu especially at a time when member states are cutting back on their spending
for example cohesion policy and structural funds are key to encouraging growth in our regions
therefore they need adequate funding and i support the increase for the structural funds
research and development in our universities and academic institutions are also important
innovation is vital and we can turn research and development into projects businesses and jobs
infrastructure investment is also crucial
investment in transport our energy networks and broadband expansion particularly in our regions will all boost jobs and growth
finally with the lisbon treaty the eu has new responsibilities and we should be prepared to put money into those new responsibilities
i would ask the commission to look at that in the future as well
