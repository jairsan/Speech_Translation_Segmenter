madam president at next week's european council summit nothing new will come from an taoiseach brian cowan in relation to the current lisbon treaty impasse in ireland
instead he will make an intervention similar to that of his colleague minister miche√°l martin where only an analysis of the results was communicated on monday to the committee on constitutional affairs of the european parliament
nothing concrete will be proposed until the december council summit where a clear road map ahead is expected to be outlined
in order to expedite moves towards this road map i would like to expound my idea on how to now move forward
first in my view there cannot be a second referendum for at least twelve months in order to allow adequate consultation with the irish electorate
a second referendum should be called during the autumn of next year possibly in october
this means that parliament elections will have to take place under the nice treaty but this is the lesser of two evils in my opinion
as to the nature of the second referendum i would propose an extended plebiscite on the lisbon treaty in ireland where we would have a constitutional referendum on yes or no to the lisbon treaty while on the same day polling consultative referenda on key opt-in opt-out issues such as the eu charter of fundamental rights and european security and defence policy
if in the extended referendum irish voters were to opt out of either of these two areas the irish government could then seek a separate agreement at the european council to be signed by all twenty-seven member states
this move would be similar to the precedent of the edinburgh agreement sought by the danes at the council meeting in december nineteen ninety-two which granted denmark four exemptions to the maastricht treaty
this allowed them to ratify the treaty overall
with this plan member states who have already ratified the lisbon treaty would not have to do so again
this extended plebiscite would offer the irish electorate a choice as to the extent of the role that they want to play within the european union
