mr president i would like to congratulate mr van nistelrooij on his report
in particular i want to support paragraph forty-two which calls for the establishment of real partnerships between all the parties involved in regional and local development at eu national regional and local level
in order to achieve territorial cohesion this is a prerequisite
the involvement of local development groups and ngos in the pursuit of regional development and territorial cohesion has been shown time and time again to add real economic and social value
given that we are not achieving territorial cohesion between our regions it is crucial that we establish and promote such partnerships
