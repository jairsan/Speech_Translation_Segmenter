mr president i think it is wonderful that both the commission and now especially the swedish presidency has breathed life into parliament's ideas and ambitions in this fragile area
we all know the problems to do with the environment of the baltic sea and the specific economic difficulties of the area
but this parliament remains ambitious and i think this parliament does want to be involved
one of the mechanisms you did not mention was the possibility of a regular report back to this parliament so that we may have a debate like today to watch how things are progressing
for me i will have the pleasure as a vice-president of this house of participating in the conference that you are organising on friday
i think there are concerns still remaining about funding to make sure that this house sees the results of this strategy that it deserves
a macro-regional economic strategy could be the way forward in other ways in other places in europe
let us hope that this one works well
