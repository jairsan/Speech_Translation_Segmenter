madam president i supported this report mainly because the paragraphs i had some concern about were either deleted or modified in a way which i felt was appropriate
they related specifically to agriculture livestock production
i would reinforce the point that the european union has considerably reduced its livestock production due to cap reforms in the past that we are now net importers of beef and that beef is produced elsewhere with the climate change concerns attached to it
this really shows us how important it is that there is global consensus on it and that while europe might lead the way we must try to insist that others follow us because we will only do ourselves harm if we are seen to be the only ones stepping up to the mark
finally i support the idea in this report of a specific year targeted towards providing information and dealing with the issue of climate change in a way which brings people along with us
there is already good work being done in this area
