madam president i would urge the house to support this extremely important motion before us this morning
it is apparent to those of us who are from rural constituencies and those who sit on the committee on agriculture and rural development that the current position that many livestock farmers find themselves in is simply unsustainable
this is not an attempt to cry wolf but if we do not rectify the problems identified within the motion we will as a consequence face higher food prices and be more reliant on third country imports
countries like china and the united states are all increasingly aware of the importance of food supply security and as a result are continuing to increase the support which they provide to agriculture
in northern ireland the beef price is well below the cost of production
as long as the cost of inputs keeps rising and extra-regulatory requirements continue to increase then many farmers will exit the industry resulting in land abandonment lack of economic activity in rural areas and a reduction in food production across the eu
it is high time we recognised the importance of food security and the value of the work carried out by farmers across europe
finally the current trade talks with the mercosur bloc are having a destabilising effect within the industry
coupled with difficult market conditionings and increasing costs the livestock sector has been burdened with the further uncertainty created by reopening of the talks
the commission is carrying on the negotiations and regardless of the utterances of the trade commissioner producers in northern ireland so far believe that the results can only be negative for european farmers and the quality of food being provided to the citizens of europe
