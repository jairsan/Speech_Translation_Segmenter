mr president i would also like to start by thanking ms <unk> and the other rapporteurs for the way that this directive has been negotiated
it has been with great warmth amongst the groups and it is very encouraging to hear that the debate on the next steps has already started
i do welcome this report
as many have mentioned forty of our energy is consumed in buildings
we need more sustainable living not only because of the carbon challenge but also because of the concerns we all share about rising energy prices and energy security
some member states are already much more ambitious in their national codes for energy efficiency and i hope that this directive will encourage others to follow suit
energy performance certificates help to raise awareness of where energy and costs can be saved and encouraging new buildings and newly refurbished buildings to have smart meters give consumers more control over their energy-related decisions
this is all good progress
this recast was born because the original directive was being poorly implemented
going forward parliament and the commission must always keep an eye on how member states are implementing this one
the commission must help please facilitate the transfer of best practice among member states and also ensure that minimum energy-performance standards are compatible whilst reflecting regional differences
we all know that to rise to the challenge of energy saving it is important that consumers both in the public and private sectors acknowledge and see the benefits which directly engaging with energy-saving initiatives can bring both in environmental and economic terms but i will give you a warning because there has been an example in my own member state of gold-plating the directive particularly in the requirements for energy performance certificates in public buildings and this has added in some cases extra bureaucratic costs with little perceived energy saving and led to a loss of public support that is regrettable
as a final point all those who fear that the eu is facing an identity crisis at the moment should take heart from this report
there has been a unity of purpose and conviction from the beginning of my involvement and i know that that goes back many years before i joined this parliament last summer
let us heed the lesson that the eu is strongest when we focus on core areas where value can be achieved by working together in a common interest
