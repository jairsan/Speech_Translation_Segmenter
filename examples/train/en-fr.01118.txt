madam president the british opposition leader has announced an intention to renegotiate parts of the lisbon treaty
that would of course require the consent of all twenty-seven countries
he has also announced the introduction of a sovereignty bill which would force a referendum in the event of further treaties
this of course could easily be repealed by subsequent governments
would the council and commission agree that the conservative leader's plans are just hot air
his party must decide either to accept the lisbon treaty or in my opinion better still take the united kingdom completely out of the european union
