mr president during the turkish invasion of cyprus in nineteen seventy-four a turkish journalist photographed fourteen cypriot soldiers surrendering to the turkish army
this photograph became the symbol of the search for the fate of the missing persons
the soldiers bodies were identified through dna a few weeks ago after they were killed thirty-five years ago and thrown down a well in the occupied northern part of the island
this demonstrates the blatant violation of the geneva convention by the turkish army who were responsible for prisoners who surrendered to them
i urge this parliament to call on turkey to cooperate with the un committee on missing persons by providing its records and by opening two recently designated plots in lapithos called restricted military areas where another eight hundred prisoners are believed to be buried
