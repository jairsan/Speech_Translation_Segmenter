mr president within a generation the population of the european union will be about six of the world's population
we are not far beyond that now which is why we simply cannot continue to rotate the presidency of the european council every six months and have up to five different people speaking on foreign affairs-related issues for the union
but also within that generation the population of the world will have increased by about two billion people
ninety per cent of that increase will be in what is now the developing world where up to eleven million children die each year about five million of them for want of medicines that have been available in what we call the west for over thirty years
in that context it is not only important that we are well organised to run europe internally it is also important that we are equipped to deal with situations like this in the developing world which is why i want to make a case for a strong independent separate commissioner for development aid who will have his or her own clear budget and remit and who will be accountable to this chamber through our committee on development
it is crucially important that the high representative minister for external affairs whatever title you want to give that person will have a lot on his or her plate much to do but there is one single issue which commands and must command our particular attention
i want to advocate strongly that not only do we continue to have an office of commissioner for development but that this portfolio is given to somebody who is equal to the task and determined to ensure that these our neighbours who are a short journey away from the european union are treated with respect this for selfish as well as selfless reasons
