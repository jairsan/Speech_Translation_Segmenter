mr president i have abandoned my prepared text because i have to say something about the proposal to have eu cultural attachés
i could not believe i was hearing it i have to say that this proposal from the commission is one of the most bizarre and ludicrous ever to come out of a body which is celebrated for its bizarre and ludicrous proposals
eu cultural attachés will simply mean more highly paid non-jobs for favoured eu civil servants paid for by the contributing countries
i have to also say that it is grossly insensitive of the commission to make this ludicrous and expensive proposal for unnecessary cultural attachés at a time of universal economic hardship
perhaps for once you will forget your own gold-plated salaries and gold-plated pensions and think of the reality of what these initiatives cost
