mr president british taxpayers will end up contributing some gbp ten billion to prop up the euro a currency we resolutely rejected as part of the gbp two hundred and fifteen billion hand-out from the international monetary fund
this is in addition to the gbp eight billion if greece defaults on its debts and gbp five billion in loan guarantees to latvia and hungary
britain may end up giving a total of gbp twenty-three billion to bolster the euro
but if the shoe was on the other foot i can only imagine that the commission would rub their hands in delight at the prospect of a failing pound and a weakened london
the recent onerous legislation on hedge funds is the clear signal of this
the invocation of article one hundred and twenty-two of the lisbon treaty is the loosest interpretation of legislation i have ever witnessed and in my opinion demonstrates a sort of political hoodwinking that proves that every paragraph of every article of every treaty is not even worth the paper it is printed on
i would suggest the justification of exceptional occurrences fails to take into account the fiscal irresponsibility that created this mess
the latest move robs britain of vital veto powers by allowing qualified majority voting on future bail-outs
