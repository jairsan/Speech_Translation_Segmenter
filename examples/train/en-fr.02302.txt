mr president the promotion and development of heritage sites in europe is a necessary and welcome project which deserves our full attention
our rich and diverse cultural heritage is something that the citizens of europe should be proud of and indeed is one of the primary reasons why millions of people from around the world visit europe every year
the project has the potential to deliver for historical sites the possibility to access additional funding and to preserve and develop their facilities which is a much needed asset during these tough economic times but where we raise expectations for citizens we have the responsibility to deliver
however from the outset this report was couched in a federalist language that sought to promote a fake or forced european demos and the attempt to rename the scheme the european union heritage label was politically based and would exclude thousands of potential locations whose history and heritage predates and indeed overshadows many contemporary sites
in addition attempts by myself and others to ensure that the focus of the label remained on heritage and not on political integration were rejected
this will inevitably lead to the unfair exclusion of many important sites
funding for this programme also raised serious concerns especially given the austerity measures currently afflicting culture departments across europe
i hope that we were able to contain this going forward
the excessive proliferation of sites and the probable duplication of the unesco scheme are also likely to add problems
the central goals of this label should have been to preserve and celebrate our shared and diverse heritage but unfortunately we have not guaranteed that we will add value
this is something that we need to be mindful of
