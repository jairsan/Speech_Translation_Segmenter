mr president i came down to the chamber while i was watching the debate in my office just to make i suppose a broad point
in ireland we have the bank guarantee scheme because of the financial crisis and we have more unity now in the eu as to how we deal with this
but we now realise that our banks will need to be recapitalised and perhaps as a matter of more urgency than we first thought
i wish to express the hope that that would happen because we have a real problem as was said by the previous speaker
we need people to spend and to invest and there just are no credit lines available
i think it is most important that something happens swiftly to restore confidence and capital to the banking system
