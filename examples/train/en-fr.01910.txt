madam president we welcome parliament's initiative to express its opinion on the future revision of the brussels i regulation
i would also like to particularly thank the rapporteur for this well-documented report which allows the european parliament to reflect on the future revision
this is the first time that parliament will be colegislating in this file which concerns the heart of civil judicial cooperation in europe
we welcome the support of parliament for the major objective of the upcoming revision which is the realisation of a true free circulation of judgments in the union
i would like to stress that the abolition of exequatur should constitute a real step forward in judicial integration that the commission does not see this as the mere removal of a superfluous formality but as a step forward in the mutual trust in each other's judicial systems and that as a result the existing refusal grounds should be reduced subject to appropriate safeguards
we welcome parliament's agreement that choice of court and arbitration agreement should be protected efficiently in the union
the commission will study the most appropriate means to achieve this objective in the union taking into account international conventions on the matter
may i indicate however that the protection of arbitration agreements should not limit the free circulation of judgments in the union
i would also stress that the european union should strengthen the judicial protection of its citizens at worldwide level creating a legal environment promoting worldwide trade and offering our european companies a level playing field when doing business outside europe
the commission invites parliament in the upcoming revision to open its position on this matter which really concerns access to justice in europe and the enforcement of rights granted by european union law
the commission welcomes parliament's support for improving provisional relief in litigation and indicates that it is exploring the best way forward not only in the context of the brussels i regulation but also with respect to the creation of a european bank attachment
i see this report as a first step in the future revision of the brussels i regulation
obviously we will have the opportunity to debate this further in the future
the commission intends to propose a revision of the regulation by the end of the year and it looks forward to cooperation with parliament for the first time on this matter
