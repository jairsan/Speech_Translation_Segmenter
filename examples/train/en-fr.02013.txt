i wish to thank the honourable member for her question
as you are aware the structural funds such as the european region development fund and the european social fund are subject to shared management
information on esf beneficiaries can be found on the social fund's website
this provides links to the social fund websites in the member states
the managing authority designated by the member state is responsible for managing and implementing operational programmes
managing authorities are there to ensure that operations are selected for cofunding in accordance with the criteria in the operational programme and member state and eu rules
there are two references to relocation in regulation no ten eighty-three two thousand and six laying down general provisions on the european regional development fund the european social fund and the cohesion fund
the first is in recital forty-two which states that when appraising major productive investment projects the commission should have all necessary information to consider whether the financial contribution from the funds does not result in a substantial loss of jobs in existing locations within the european union in order to ensure that community funding does not support relocation within the european union
the second reference is in article fifty-seven which stipulates that managing authorities or member states must ensure that cofunded investments are maintained for at least five years after completion of the operation
where an operation fails to meet that requirement the eu contribution should be recovered
managing authorities must inform the commission in their annual implementation reports of operations that have not met the requirements for the maintenance of investment provided for in that article and the commission is to inform the other member states
the commission and the member states must ensure that undertakings which are or have been the subject of a recovery procedure do not receive a contribution from the funds following the transfer of a productive activity between regions within the member state or to another member state
the commission is assisted in the monitoring of restructuring activities by the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions with the european restructuring monitor
in the case of state aid schemes there is also a requirement for the investment to be maintained for a period of five years for regional investment aid and employment aid
the commission has set up a state aid web-based search tool which provides information on state aid cases and on block exemption cases recorded
lastly in accordance with the publicity requirements member states sharing management of european union funds have to publish a list of beneficiaries of operations and the corresponding amounts of public funding
