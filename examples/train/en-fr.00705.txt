mr president i am very privileged this morning to be sitting next to mr daniel hannan my very good colleague whose speech a few weeks ago has revolutionised the transmission of information and political thought and will change it for the future
the power of the internet is supremely important but is even more important over the regular media
i voted against this report for one simple reason which is that i am not in favour of promoting european citizenship
i am a british citizen and am proud to be so and what we should be about is promoting the individual citizenship of our individual countries and saying yes we are members of the european union as countries but we are not european citizens
we are citizens of the countries which gave us our birth and infant nurture which protect us and which have given many of us sanctuary over the years
that is the pride which i have and will continue to have in the years to come
