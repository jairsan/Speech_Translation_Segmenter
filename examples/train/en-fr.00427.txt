mr president the prison at guantánamo bay was a necessary creation of the united states at the time
its closure is now a matter for the united states
i oppose eu member states entangling themselves in the inevitable legal complications and the burden imposed on our security services of taking non-eu national prisoners previously designated as enemy combatants
i do not regret the detention of the most dangerous terrorists intent on destroying our way of life when they were proven to be so
however one of guantánamo's major drawbacks was that it forestalled any regular criminal proceedings against those held there
ultimately regular criminal trials are the only way to resolve the status of guantánamo prisoners who are non-eu nationals
since the inmates of guantánamo were captured by the united states it is america's responsibility to prosecute them in its own courts or return them to their countries of origin if innocent
if president obama is serious about closing guantánamo which i welcome and about protecting america and its allies this should be his policy
