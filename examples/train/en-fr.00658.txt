mr president the catch-the-eye procedure agreed by this house does not lay down that the president may select members according to which group they belong to
the catch-the-eye procedure as i understand it is for each individual member to catch the eye of you the president
i think it is regrettable that you have just said you will only allow three members of the ppe-de group to speak
that is not in accordance with our rules of procedure
