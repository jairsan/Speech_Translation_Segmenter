madam president a couple of weeks ago i was having one of my favourite meals a curry in the village of long buckby near to where i live and i was hosting a group of people who are new to politics in a political discussion
like everybody and you all know this as a member of the european parliament they immediately think a number of things
firstly that you are on the gravy train and you do not really care about ordinary people and secondly that europe is not working there are too many regulations
maybe in some cases they are right there should be a cost-benefit analysis of what the regulations are and they are badly implemented in fact not uniformly implemented across the continent
this report talks about the monitoring of community law and that is a good thing
if you look at the eurobarometer web site you will see the number of infringement cases that the commission takes out against individual member states
but this lack of implementation and equal implementation is one of the biggest problems that people in this chamber who are not like me who are europhile rather than euro-sceptic have to face in the future
