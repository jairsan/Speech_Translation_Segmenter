mr president high representative ashton has asked us this morning to change mental maps to challenge resistance to institutional change and to avoid narrow defence of national interests
if parliament means what it says on the cfsp we have to send a clear message that we will support a strong comprehensive and inclusive external action service and in observing our own prerogatives we will not be part of any vested interests seeking to limit the capacity and therefore the effectiveness of that service
that should mean appointments on merit and merit alone appointments from member state foreign ministries from day one and from across all of the european union it means incorporation of strategic advice on issues like energy supply and environmental policy it means organisational structures which reflect global reach and give due weight to africa and to transatlantic relations as well as to asia latin america and our neighbourhood it means sufficient financial margin not just for rapid reaction or humanitarian response but to move monies to reflect new political priorities it means endorsing cathy ashton's decision to put disaster response above disaster tourism and for her to provide key direction to financial programming and it means this parliament supporting new arrangements with deputising which reflect international practice rather than necessarily sticking to our past rules
finally i am delighted to see the commission seat empty this morning and for all those who campaigned for the lisbon treaty we should not restrict their or our support for its full implementation
