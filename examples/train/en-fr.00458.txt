you mentioned the review of the late payments directive which i think is extremely important
i was concerned though that the consultation period for that finished at the end of august just before the real financial crisis hit
had the consultation period been extended i think we might have got much more robust answers as a basis for a better review of the directive
is it worth considering whether we should open a further short period of consultation so that we get the most up-to-date information possible on which a review could then be based
