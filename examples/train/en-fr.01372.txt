mr president the persecution of christians and other religious minorities is growing in islamic countries
christians who have lived in countries such as egypt and in the mediterranean area for almost two zero years are increasingly being persecuted and driven out of their ancestral homelands
this is because of the growing power of intolerant fundamentalist and extremist islamist ideology islamo-fascism
the persecution of christian minorities and others across the islamic world is vastly under-reported by the west's media
the media should not only report the persecution as it happens but they should explain to the general public the reasons why it is happening
they should explain who is doing this namely muslim fanatics and why they are doing it because of the intolerant and violent fault lines in islamic ideology
democratic governments worldwide should put maximum diplomatic pressure on countries such as egypt to suppress this intolerable persecution
