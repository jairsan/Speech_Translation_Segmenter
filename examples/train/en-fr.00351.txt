i am not sure if bookmakers and tote operators and operators of the pari-mutuels qualify under the professions but certainly in terms of the single market and free movement of services it is an issue
where is this debate at
i do know that the commission's offices have been involved and i am still receiving quite a lot of vexed representation in this area
secondly as regards recognition of the professional qualifications directive and the whole area of mutual evaluation which the commissioner referred to are any problems likely there
are we comparing like with like if we are opening up professions in one member state to another
