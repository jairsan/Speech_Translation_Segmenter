madam president much can be inferred from the title of this report perspectives for developing civil dialogue under the treaty of lisbon
never mind that as it seems periodically necessary to remind this house the treaty of lisbon is not in force
it has been three times rejected in its several forms by fifty-five of french voters by sixty-two of dutch voters and by fifty-four of irish voters
focus rather on the orwellian ministry of love bit of the title perspectives for developing civil dialogue
now ordinary voters unversed in the peculiar idiom of the european union might not understand those words as we in this house do to mean creating a new propaganda budget to try and convince people to change their minds
i have to say that not every euro in the vaults of the european central bank will serve to convince people of an intrinsically bad idea
dialogue by definition involves two parties
the eu has to be able to receive as well as transmit
that means putting the treaty to a referendum
