mr president as has already been said the european union is the single largest donor institution to cambodia and it is more than legitimate for us to call on the cambodian authorities not only to engage in political and institutional reforms to build a democratic state governed by the rule of law and founded on the respect of fundamental freedoms and rights but also to demonstrate the will to combat effectively the endemic scourge of corruption massive deforestation resulting in the displacement of people land grabbing and the sex tourism industry to refuse the current culture of impunity and to bring to justice all those involved in such activities
the guarantee of free and fair political expression without intimidation or harassment is also a necessity
more specifically we should state that we are alarmed at the prosecution and sentencing to a total of twelve years in prison of the opposition leader sam rainsy on account of a gesture which it considers to be of a symbolic and clearly political nature
it is particularly alarming that if upheld this verdict would bar sam rainsy from standing in the twenty thirteen parliamentary elections and have consequences far beyond rainsy's case as it is bound to affect the opposition as such
