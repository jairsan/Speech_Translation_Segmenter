mr president i just wish the house to know that i was the original rapporteur on the decision on frontex and i recommended that we adopt this because of the exceptional measures that are necessary to deal with intervention and rescue at sea especially in the southern mediterranean
the committee did not back me and therefore i removed my name from this report and i will be recommending to the house that they reject the resolution that is now before them
we need an absolute majority of three hundred and sixty-nine for it to be adopted but i would recommend that the house reject the resolution that we are about to vote on
