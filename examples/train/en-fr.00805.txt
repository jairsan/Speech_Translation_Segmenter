madam president i think once again this is one of those reports that many people can welcome
in the battle for better energy conservation and more efficient energy use i think we all want to see more energy-efficient products
but once again i have to draw attention to the fact that we should be leading by example in this house
when we talk about energy efficiency we should make sure that we put our own house in order
the european parliament has three buildings two parliament buildings and one administrative building one in brussels one in strasbourg and one in luxembourg
that clearly shows that we ourselves are not walking the walk when it comes to energy efficiency
it is time to lead by example
it is time to put the battle for energy efficiency at the forefront
we need to close down the strasbourg parliament close down the luxembourg administrative buildings and stay in brussels
