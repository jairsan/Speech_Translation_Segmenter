first of all i think that the fact that this parliament voted again for a mandate for myself is a signal that there is support for the action we have been taking
having said that there are issues that we have to change and to improve
the situation today is different
there is a much greater sense of social urgency than before
as i have said very often the most important problem we face in europe today which most likely we are going to face for some time yet is unemployment
we have to find not only new sources of growth but also to look at what was wrong with the previous model of growth
it was obvious that the previous model of growth was dilapidated
although it created some artificial bubbles not only in the financial sector but also in other sectors it was not sustainable including from an energy and climate point of view
that is the focus of my strategy the strategy i have put forward to this parliament and which i hope to develop with the next commission in of course very close association with this parliament
