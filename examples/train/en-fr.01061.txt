this question is still related to a certain extent to my previous answer as to how we can combine better dietary practices how we can promote a healthier lifestyle and how we can bring european value added to the national policies in these areas
i should first of all mention that the commission's white paper a strategy for europe on nutrition overweight and obesity-related health issues highlighted the importance of taking proactive steps to reverse the decline in physical activity and the actions suggested in the area of physical activity in this white paper and in the white paper on sport mutually reinforce and complement each other
the commission has created a high level group on nutrition and physical activity where officials from all member states can exchange policy ideas and best practices and gain an overview of all government policies in this area
as you probably know this high level group meets at least three times a year
through the public health programme the commission has been giving support to initiatives among others to network local partnerships targeting nutrition and physical activity in young people
coming back to the white paper on nutrition i have to underline that this paper highlights that the private sector and ngos have very important roles to play in helping us to ensure that there will be an actual decline in obesity levels
the work of the european platform on diet physical activity and health is ongoing and platform members commit themselves to actions in their area to try to reverse the trend
in the area of sport the white paper remains the single most important reference point
it foresees several actions in the area of sport and health known under the concept of health-enhancing physical activity hepa which include the support of the hepa network
it also proposed more funding opportunities for projects in this area namely in the context of the seventh framework programme for research and technological development the eu public health programme the youth and citizenship programmes and the lifelong learning programme
the eu physical activity guidelines adopted in two thousand and eight can also be regarded as a contribution to informing citizens about the benefits of physical activity and maintaining an appropriate balance between nutrition and physical activity
the commission is currently implementing a preparatory action in the field of sport in order to prepare future eu actions in accordance with the budgetary decisions taken by parliament and the two thousand and nine preparatory action has already provided a clear indication about the high interest in the area of hepa with sixty-four of the applications for the action being in this area
