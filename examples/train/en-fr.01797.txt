mr president today we are debating a very important and well-drafted report on an important area close to the eu the south caucasus
the area motivates perfectly the general recommendations of the eu security strategy
it is strategically located it allows for the transport of caspian oil and gas towards the eu and it has its own significant reserves
that requires our total attention and determination to act
however precisely because it is strategically and energetically relevant the area is fiercely contested by foreign powers exploiting its internal divisions and conflicts be they still frozen or defrosting
if the eu is interested in making full use of the potential of the south caucasus then it must act together rather than individually and be more resolute in its actions even if that involves making others less happy
for that we need a strategy
