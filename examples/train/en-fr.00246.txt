mr president tonight we are discussing a very important piece of legislation and our discussion and our vote in this parliament will send a very clear message to workers and to families across the eu
in ireland we have a question we ask when we are discussing social policy and that question is are we closer to boston or berlin
well in the context of tonight's discussion we need to be closer to berlin that is if berlin or indeed paris can deliver a real advancement for the health and safety of workers
i listened to mrs l√©tard and she asked us to behave responsibly and i believe mr cercas has done just that
at the council meeting last week in the discussion of the treaty of lisbon a commitment was given by the council to strengthen workers rights
the council and parliament now have an opportunity to do just that
furthermore we often speak in parliament about work life balance and everybody nods their head in agreement
once again we have an opportunity to help ensure work life balance for europe's citizens
and remember as already mentioned by mr silva peneda forty-eight hours per week is eight hours per day six days per week
mr bushill-matthews spoke of a woman working twelve hours per day seven days per week as if that were acceptable
it is totally unacceptable and we should not be complicit in this type of exploitation
as i said earlier tonight's debate and our vote on this report will send a clear signal to the citizens of europe
we need to send a clear message that social europe is alive and well
