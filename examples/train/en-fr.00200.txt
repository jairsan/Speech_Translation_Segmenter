madam president hiv prevention and treatment capacity varies across different socio-economic and geopolitical settings
promoting the early diagnosis of hiv infection should be a component of all comprehensive approaches to addressing aids
even in countries where anti-retroviral treatment options are severely limited important contributions to health can be achieved through the diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections among hiv-infected persons
in a recent us research publication it was found that the time between self-reported dates of hiv diagnosis and presentation for care had in fact increased
the interval between diagnosis and presentation was substantially greater among injection drug users than among other risk groups
combined with this is a problem of the growing perception that aids is now a treatable condition which undermines the public health message calling for frequent testing and prompt treatment of hiv
