mr president as the vice-president of the euromed assembly's committee on energy environment and water i had the opportunity to see the concrete and dramatic ecological reality of the jordan river area during a field visit which took place last february
the special report on the situation in the jordan valley for which i was rapporteur highlighted the fact that all parties concerned in particular israel the palestinian authority and jordan but also lebanon and syria must find a common solution to the two most pressing problems an equal distribution of water that respects the need of all the people in the region and a healthy and protected environment for the generations to come
the first step identified in our report is that israel and the palestinian authorities have to agree together on common data concerning available water distribution and demographics as a starting point for further negotiations since both sides as well as independent reports have presented different figures up to now
one of our main conclusions was that in order to solve the water problem by cooperation it is necessary to implement plans for a joint administration decision making on an equal footing and the joint management of water resources in the region
i believe that the recommendations in our report match areas where the european union has a real expertise and could be involved as an active player paving the way for future partnership between the parties involved
in conclusion i would like to remind you that while efforts are being made to resume the discussion towards an overall peace agreement we have the responsibility not to use the situation in the jordan valley for political and ideological purposes
i hope our debate today will serve the interests of all parties in the region and lead to concrete and unbiased conclusions for an active involvement of the union towards future sustainable solutions
