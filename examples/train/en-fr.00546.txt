mr president i support this measure and its aim of promoting best available techniques for environmental protection but i do have concerns about parliament's methodology on it
this is essentially a directive for regulating heavy industry but buried in the text and in the annex are a number of paragraphs that directly affect farmers
there was no opportunity for the agriculture committee to give its opinion and unfortunately some of the proposals that affect farmers are quite inappropriate
in particular the requirements on manure and slurry duplicate the nitrates directive and the water framework directive
the lower thresholds on poultry drag small family farms into a complex regulatory framework designed to control global industrial giants
this directive is not the place to regulate small farms
