madam president i am glad to be able to comment on this
i am concerned about the european union's involvement in this matter simply because this is a matter for international agreement and one-sided action by the european union would make really no difference
furthermore i think the reference in the report to the european security arrangements is unfortunate
the basis of european security is nato
it always has been and it always will be and that is so because nato includes our friend and ally the united states of america
certain parts of this parliament are very anti-american
i am not
i remember the debt that this continent owes to the united states for our freedom and our membership of nato
our alliance with the united states through nato is the basis of our defence and security and will be in the years to come
