mr president first i want to say that this is a topic that is very difficult to get a definitive answer on what is right and what is wrong
we all know ever since nine eleven that we are living in a very dangerous world where there are terrorists at large who have all day every day to spend planning their deadly missions and they have the economic resources some of it state-sponsored to carry out their missions
for that reason it is difficult for those who are trying to combat terrorism to prove how effective they are but i think we could safely say that if the terrorists had their way this place would have been blown up long ago
while it is important that parliament would have oversight on restrictions on individuals rights etc
at the same time we have to put our faith in those who are in charge of security
i think the evidence is there that they have done a good job
sometimes we may not be able to know all the details of individuals involved but at the same time the overall principle is a good one
