mr president i would like to thank mr lamassoure for his report
the entry into force of the lisbon treaty will modify the rules in the budget sector with the european parliament and the council as codeciders on an equal footing on all expenditures
it will imply a new legal framework which will require careful consideration between the institutions
as our common responsibility is to ensure that the budget processes and operations run continuously and smoothly i share the rapporteur's views that we need to agree on transitional guidelines urgently
these transitional rules are of a rather technical nature and they will only be in force until the new legal framework enters into force
the rapporteur has identified the right issues to be discussed in his report
we will need new rules to operate transfers and new rules to adopt amending budgets
we will need a timetable that will allow an adequate involvement of all actors
we will also need to agree on clear collaboration principles and if necessary we will need some rules on provisional twelfths
i can confirm here that i am ready to make the necessary suggestions in order to reach a balanced agreement
i propose that we start discussing these issues in the trialogue that we will have this afternoon
i hope the three institutions will be able to reach an agreement during the november conciliation
