mr president this appears to be the catalyst which started the whole thing off
i do not want any british meps to be here anyway
i do not see why we should have to put up with foreign institutions like this running our affairs
the further we go to the south and east the worse the culture of corruption becomes
i do not like it and i do not want my country to have any part in it
