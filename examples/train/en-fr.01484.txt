mr president it is just under one hundred years since all women were given the right to vote in the united kingdom
fighting for women's rights is not a new phenomenon and i want to pay tribute to all the women's organisations round the world that are still fighting for equality between men and women
women want to be able to make independent choices about their careers or their family aspirations the choice to work in a traditionally male occupation or equally the choice to look after children and work in the home
what we really need to do is empower women
we as conservatives believe in choice and with choice flexibility for women and subsequently equality
are we unintentionally making women less employable by demanding that businesses offer rights that they cannot deliver in today's economic climate
equally do we put women off staying at home with children because we as a society value this less than the workplace
the commissioner rightly said that we need to get women out of the recession and back working
i say we also need to secure jobs in small businesses and this will help us achieve this goal
through over-legislation we are risking the demise of small businesses thus in turn limiting the very choices we are fighting to give women and consequently the equality they deserve
