mr president two months ago my constituency was hit by disastrous floods
deceitfully blamed on climate change the real reason for the devastation of the town of cockermouth was the eu-imposed privatisation theft of public services
the proper management of reservoirs has been replaced by cost-cutting negligence by united utilities leading to safety margins being ignored and a panic-stricken decision to open sluice gates and release a man-made deluge on the town
the fact that only one brave man died in the floods was little short of miraculous but such disasters will increase in frequency as more and more public services are looted by greedy corporations
finally my constituents are shocked that they will not receive a penny from the eu solidarity fund because the uk cannot apply unless the damage exceeds eur three billion
since britain is not in an earthquake zone it is almost impossible to conceive of a disaster which would trigger such a payment so british taxpayers who contribute a disproportionate amount to the funds have no realistic chance of benefiting from it
so much for solidarity
we want our money back
