i am very supportive of serbia making progress towards eu accession as i am all of the western balkans as a former member of the relevant european parliament delegation
the problem is that when we say serbia's accession will depend on full cooperation with the icty this begs the question of when exactly we will make this criterion bite
i really want to try and get from the commissioner the fact that no further progress will be made now in the next few weeks unless these fugitives are delivered
can he also tell me that no further progress can be made regarding croatia's accession unless the icty is satisfied that there is full cooperation over evidence and witnesses regarding the croatian invitees
