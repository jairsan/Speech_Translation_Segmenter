madam president i was due to talk about the pressures unlimited eu migration is putting on the uk
forgive me for raising a pressing matter recently brought to my attention
as a coordinator on the regional development committee and an mep for wales it was with great concern that i received a leaked copy of a draft communication of the european commission entitled
the document proposes a major refocusing of the eu's spending priorities placing greater emphasis on and i paraphrase a global europe and less on agriculture and transfers towards well-off regions
this will have a huge impact on british agriculture and structural fund programmes in this current cycle
as a net contributor the united kingdom will be forced to give up much more of the rebate whilst other countries will be the main beneficiaries
eleven point eight of funds earmarked for the uk under the cohesion policy go to the poorest regions in wales
i am very concerned that this leaked document may have consequences for transitional payments at the end of the current programme in twenty thirteen
it is time the people of the uk had a referendum on its relationship with this place so they can be the people who decide their destiny not unelected bureaucrats
