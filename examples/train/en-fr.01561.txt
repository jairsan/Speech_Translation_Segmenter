mr president i am very happy to support the lehne report which will help to reduce the administrative burden on micro-enterprises
one of the things that comes up again and again when you speak with small businesses is the issue of over-regulation and red tape and of being smothered under a deluge of paperwork
they do have a sound argument when they say that it is reasonable as micro-enterprises that they should not be subject to the same rules and regulations as bigger business
the decision we took today is a sensible one and a well-founded response to the concerns of struggling small businesses in europe
most of the time we are proposing new legislation in this house but today we modified a piece of legislation
this will lead to a better business environment and increased competitiveness for small businesses and was well worth doing
