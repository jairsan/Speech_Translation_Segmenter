madam president i do not want to ask for the budget to be bust all i want to ask is that we meet the commitments we have given to the developing world
eleven million children die every year in the developing world
these are people who are hit not just by the financial crisis in the way we are but by the fact that they do not even get the remittances which were greater than the financial assistance we gave them from their families living in the developed world because they too are suffering
these people are suffering doubly they are also suffering from the consequences of climate change
all i want us to do is to meet our commitment to these people
if our gnp goes down a percentage our contribution to these people also goes down
so let us meet the percentage contribution we said we would make
clarity in the budget line so that we can measure here in parliament that you are meeting those commitments and additionality are absolutely central to this
please in all of this do not ask the poorest people in the world to carry a burden they are not able to carry
