mr president following the report by the honourable member mrs guy-quint dated april two thousand and eight the new legal framework affecting budgetary matters should now be ready for adoption
all the institutions agreed that this would be the case so as to avoid any legal vacuum
we should therefore have no need for transitional guidelines on budgetary matters
the report from the honourable member mr lamassoure focuses on the approval of amending budgets and transfers both of which constitute risky and inadequate practices that reveal a lack of professionalism as concerns the budgeting and planning process and are bound to become more risky in transitional periods
the current number of amending budgets is excessive and does not even comply with the conditions set out in article thirty-seven of the financial regulation
the current number of transfers is also excessive and would not occur if the planning of the budget was done with a better understanding of the needs of the different sectors in the different countries
as a member of the committee on budgets i am appalled to see almost the whole committee except for me approve all of these requests for transfers
therefore no amending budgets or transfers should be approved during the transitional period and all efforts should be concentrated on the adoption of the legal framework so as to avoid further damage to the interests of taxpayers
