madam president many members of this parliament may not be aware of a very nasty war of words raging on this issue of adoption which is most unhelpful and unwelcome
if we are truly to put the rights of the child at the centre of this debate which we did in this house and which this resolution also does then we will do the right thing for all children no matter which member state they were born in
it is important not to pick on any particular member state but to recognise that all countries have children who are abandoned or not cared for within the nuclear family as we know it and who need other forms of caring
yes there are many families willing to give loving homes to children
while perhaps we need to look at the bureaucracy let us not diminish the scrutiny
can i finally say that to some extent those who adopt and are successful are put through much more rigour than those who simply give birth
