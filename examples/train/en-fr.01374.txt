mr president last month mr liu xiaobo the very well-known writer and political activist was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for incitement to subvert state power
he was arrested over a year ago after drafting charter eight a charter which was signed by more than ten zero ordinary chinese citizens demanding the most normal things in a democratic society the right to free speech open elections and rule of law
the prosecution of mr liu xiaobo based solely on his peaceful initiatives and the judicial harassment he faced are undoubtedly incompatible with internationally acknowledged norms of human rights and fundamental freedoms
therefore we should call strongly for mr liu xiaobo's unconditional release which should take place immediately
in the last few years relations between the european union and china have focused mainly on the economic dimension which has overshadowed the country's democratic record and the gross human rights violations which have systematically occurred in china
a few days ago for the first time a police official admitted that the famous human rights lawyer and two thousand and eight nobel peace prize nominee mr gao zhisheng had gone missing after a year in the chinese authorities custody
many people fear that he might be dead
a few weeks ago the chinese government disregarded an eu appeal not to execute a british citizen
it is particularly disturbing to see how the chinese government ignores its international commitments in the field of human rights
one is entitled to wonder why under these circumstances china submitted its candidacy to the un human rights council was it simply to legitimise the way it suppresses human rights
in april two thousand and nine the chinese government issued a national human rights plan a lengthy document which appears to be nothing but a piece of paper
there must be no doubt
this house the european parliament has the obligation to thoroughly evaluate the results of the eu-china human rights dialogue
