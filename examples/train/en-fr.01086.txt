mr president with the lisbon treaty approaching we expect the october european council to make progress on one of the priority issues the european external action service
the european parliament has consistently called for the creation of a genuine common european diplomacy
the eas has the potential to ensure the unity and consistency of our external action which is most needed if the union is to act with one voice and meet external challenges such as energy security in an efficient manner
to seize the opportunity offered by setting up the eas we expect the council to take into consideration the position of the european parliament adopted this week in the committee on constitutional affairs and especially the following
to have a strong external policy we need to equip the new head of european diplomacy with proper instruments to enable him or her to strengthen our foreign policy
the eas should be based on the community method with the clear involvement of the commission and the european parliament
the scope of the hr's competence needs to be large involving such cfsp-related policies as enlargement neighbourhood trade and development
the condition for a strong coherent foreign policy is democratic legitimacy which can only be provided by the strong involvement of the european parliament
this involvement should be considered at two stages ex ante consultation of the parliament during the process of setting up the service and ex ante consultation of the parliament in setting foreign policy goals
once the high representative and the service are in place the european parliament should have a strong mandate to play an active role in the scrutiny of the eu's foreign policy and the service
in the implementation phase we should not allow the lisbon treaty-based foreign policy provisions to be diluted
the democratic legitimacy of the new service also depends on its composition
the geographic balance of the union should be taken into account
fair representation of all member states in the eu institutions is a core principle and the eas should be no exception
