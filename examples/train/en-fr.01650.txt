you should put the question on a specific timeframe to commission rehn but when you look at the recommendations that we have been making and the agreement that has been made to support greece in particular by a combination of bilateral loans and international monetary fund support it is clear that the commission is of the opinion that what happened now in any case could not be resolved by the putting into place of a european monetary fund because this would certainly take much more time than we have with respect to greece
so this is a medium-term project that we are sympathetic with but with respect to a specific timeframe i really suggest you put the question to mr rehn
