mr president the european commission has already tried to create an eu patent law but failed in june when this was rejected by the council which failed to achieve a unanimous vote
the commission however wants to forge ahead with this
the fact that it does so is just another example of eu empire-building
the proposals are unnecessary and will impose yet more administrative and cost burdens on innovative companies
so exactly who is in favour of this
it is being driven forward by twelve countries that include the united kingdom
it should surprise no one that the british coalition government is a prime mover in this just as successive british governments have been prime movers in most eu projects while pretending to do the opposite
if the conservative party had ever thought to patent lies deceit and hypocrisy they would have made a fortune in royalties and would perhaps be in a position to pay off the national debt
