thank you very much for your comments
i can assure you of my commitment to assisting the fleets of the outermost regions as far as i can and as far as this is possible
however let me stress that maintaining or even increasing capacity of these fleets is not the solution and can indeed be part of the problem
as i stated in my opening remarks if there needs to be a measure of restructuring of these fleets i would urge you to consider the recently adopted fuel package that provides for a number of possibilities that may be beneficial to the fleets of the outermost regions
again as i said i can accept the extension of the deadline for entry into the fleet register in view of the backlog problems faced by shipyards but i cannot accept the further extension for the granting of public aid for construction and for the entry-exit regime beyond what had already been granted under the european fisheries fund where special consideration was made for the outermost regions since this will not solve any problems but will only serve to generate more problems
we accept that there is overfishing and we acknowledge that this is due to overcapacity
the commission does not want to contribute to overcapacity in peripheral regions as well because this will only cause problems for the future
with regard to the possibility of overfishing around the peripheral regions we have been looking into this and the council has just adopted a regulation on iuu fishing with the european parliament's blessing
as from one january twenty ten no fish that are not certified as having been legally caught can enter the european market
we are also taking the lead in regional fisheries organisations in order to propose sustainable fishing in the oceans wherever we have a voice and that is in virtually all regional fisheries organisations
we intend to persevere with this effort so that in this way we can guarantee sustainable fishing not only in our waters but in international waters which are so crucial for our outermost regions
