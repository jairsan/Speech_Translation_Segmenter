madam president it is essential that amendment thirty with special regard to paragraph seven a be adopted
self-employed drivers would not then be included in these provisions
it is not a road safety issue
all drivers are limited to driving times and associated work monitored by the tachograph
including the self-employed drivers will penalise them especially those who do not use an agency
company drivers have their schedule provided but true independents spend time preparing their own schedules and bidding for new business
if included in these provisions those tasks will be part of their working week so they will have less time to drive load unload and cater for passengers as compared to the commercially employed drivers
thus business will be lost and unemployment caused in the small business sector
the bigger operator will take up the slack and we will have another example of the eu promoting big business at the expense of the smes who employ half the workforce
i therefore support the rapporteur in amendment thirty as well as the commission in this respect
you do not hear that very often from this part of the house
