mr president i abstained on the financial transaction taxes resolution because it is hopelessly inadequate for tackling the obscene antisocial speculation around the world by giant hedge funds and so-called prestigious banks like goldman sachs
recently reported on a private dinner in new york on eight february involving eighteen major hedge funds where speculation against the euro was discussed
for months now these financial sharks known as hedge funds which control over eur two zero billion have been deliberately speculating against the euro and against greece in particular in order to reap billions in private profit
incredibly the eu commission not only fails to raise a finger to stop them but actually conspires with these financial criminals by bullying the workers and poor of greece demanding that their living standards be savaged to pay the ransom demanded by these parasites
we do not need a financial tax
what we need is to take public ownership and democratic control of these hedge funds and major banks in order to use their massive resources for investment that will end poverty and benefit society rather than destroying society for private greed
