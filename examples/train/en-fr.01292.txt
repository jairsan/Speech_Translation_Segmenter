mr president i think it is unfortunate that in this christmas season we have spent the last two days discussing violence around the world be it in chechnya or in afghanistan and now in the congo
but nevertheless that is the reality
at the same time taking the message of the festive season of peace and goodwill we must as my colleague mr mitchell put it so well become sponsors of peace
and this is a great opportunity for the high representative lady ashton to use the power and support of the european union in a way that could not have been done before to bring these countries to order and to try and alleviate the terrible suffering in these places
the long-term solution though will come not from economic improvement but from education and we have to try and ensure free access to proper education in these countries because that is really the way to peace in the long term
