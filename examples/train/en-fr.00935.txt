mr president this parliament has united in recent times in the face of a global terrorist threat
in my constituency of northern ireland we know the pain of terrorism
yes we have witnessed a transformation in northern ireland in recent years but there are still those who would seek to cause bloodshed
last week in the latest of a series of incidents a six hundred lb bomb was planted by dissident republicans and was discovered in south armagh
had it not been discovered multiple loss of life would have occurred
in northern ireland we have not forgotten the victims of our past and of terrorism and that is why i would ask this parliament to back the campaign for compensation from libya
libya supplied weapons to the ira
those weapons took many lives and left others destroyed
for this they must be held accountable
