madam president in ireland they are asking us whether there is great excitement now that the lisbon treaty has been ratified
in truth i tell them there is not because it took so long and the birth and delivery were so difficult
there is relief and some pleasure but a realisation as there is in this debate that the real work begins now and that it is a tough job to appoint the right people
it is not about jobs for the boys and girls but about appointing the right people for all of those very important positions that have been created
i am sorry that it is taking extra time to do that because it does delay the final formation of all the institutions and we have a lot of work to do but perhaps it is better that we have that slight delay and get the right people in place
the top jobs as we have described them are important and they will require people with commitment dedication and a desire to improve the european union not just to be in a job
lastly on strong institutions mr barroso is absolutely right
you need to hear what we are saying in this parliament
listen carefully
we are the closest to our electorate
we are directly elected
