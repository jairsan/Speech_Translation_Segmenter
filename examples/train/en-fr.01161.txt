mr president i have just heard a socialist colleague over there talking about greenland and the ice melting in greenland
the question i would like to ask on this subject is why is greenland called greenland
is it perhaps because greenland was once green when the world was hotter
it seems that the british people are onto this because a recent opinion poll in newspaper clearly shows that the british people no longer believe in so-called man-made global warming
the british people are very astute and they are clear that politicians have hijacked the environmentalist agenda
it is being cynically used to raise taxes to exert control and now it is being used by the european union to justify its own existence
this week we have also had the spectacle of one of the leading climate-research centres in the uk which advises the government being caught altering data and stifling debate
it is an absolute disgrace
i look forward to copenhagen when the political class is sitting around the table awkwardly failing to mention the giant elephant in the room which is that the globe has not actually warmed for the past ten years
