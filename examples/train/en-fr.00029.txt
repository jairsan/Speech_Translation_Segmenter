mr president i believe there are a number of principles that have to be addressed in this issue
the first is that patients health obviously has to be at the heart of it
we must not leave the issue of these rights to decision by the courts
we as lawmakers must make the law in this area
thirdly competition must not be encouraged or be the outcome of this directive between national health services nor indeed should competition generally be encouraged in this area
