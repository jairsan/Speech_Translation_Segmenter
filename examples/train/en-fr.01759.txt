madam president once again i am appalled to see how the members of this parliament continue to demand budget increases while people in the member countries are struggling to live through the present crisis
but today i will refer to the ethics of this house
in the present situation is it acceptable that while they demand power to control national budgets the european institutions want to increase their own administrative budgets as is the case with this parliament
is it acceptable that the eu institutions go to the court of justice over the council's decision to moderate the increase in salaries of eu civil servants
is it ethically acceptable for parliament to rush out its approval of the council's two thousand and eight accounts in exchange for the latter's approval of parliament's budget increases
let me explain the budgetary control committee has voted unanimously against approving the council's two thousand and eight accounts due to a lack of transparency
coincidentally the council has failed to approve budget increases for parliament
i guess that we will see parliament voting in favour of approving the council's accounts this week and shortly afterwards the council will be approving extra budget for the parliament
these votes ladies and gentlemen of europe the ones for parliament's budget and the council's discharge are representative of the ethics of the institutions that aim to govern all of us
