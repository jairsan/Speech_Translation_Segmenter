mr president the european union has set up budgetary instruments to provide support to workers who are being made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns many of which have been influenced directly or indirectly by the european union
however this represents a piecemeal approach
subsidising the training of those who have lost their jobs in certain industries will not resolve the situation of the said industries nor will it help to create an alternative industry that will absorb this workforce
this is just a waste of taxpayers money
if the european union was really looking to help europe out of the crisis it should be investigating and working on the causes of the crisis but it prefers to be seen as the charity that will come to rescue the poor
of course this action will initially return support for the european union from those affected
moreover the report and the motion for a resolution being proposed for vote do not indicate what the scope of this subsidy will be i
how many industries it will cover and how many companies within a certain industry
what is most worrying is that the report emphasises the need to speed up the payments of the subsidies without ever mentioning the need to provide evidence that the funds are reaching the right people for the right purpose
worse still the report does not call for regular monitoring of the effects of the subsidy leaving this evaluation to the general assessment of the programmes within the process of the two thousand and seven twenty thirteen multiannual financial framework
colleagues we are talking about taxpayers money many of whom have also lost their jobs and are getting no subsidies many of whom are going through severe financial problems
how can we treat their money with such contempt
i will reject this resolution and urge you to do the same
