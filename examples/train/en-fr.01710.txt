mr president in january and march we witnessed mass atrocities in nigeria which caused the deaths of several hundred people including women and children
what is necessary for nigeria is first of all a reconciliation process and the peaceful coexistence between muslims living in the north and christians living in the south
secondly taking into account that despite nigeria being one of the biggest oil producers in the world most of its people still live in poverty
they do not benefit from the overall development of the country so corruption which is widespread has to be challenged and fought effectively and seriously
thirdly european union assistance to nigeria should address the most important problems the most sensitive issues in order to achieve at least some visible progress in this country
