mr president i want to raise a voice of concern and caution in this frenzied debate about climate change particularly as it could affect food production
we are told that the world population will spiral to nine billion by twenty fifty thus food production must correspondingly increase
yet within this proposed climate change package we have emission-reduction demands which if met would reduce food production when we need it most
i refer in particular to the targets on methane and nitrous oxide and the assault on meat and dairy consumption
these reduction targets cannot be met without serious diminution in food production
faced with the choice of feeding the world or ticking climate change correction boxes i am afraid i am on the side of common sense and necessity
