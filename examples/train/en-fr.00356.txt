mr president i just want to put on the record that i voted against the cappato report in the end because i believe there is a better report due before parliament which will deal with these matters
i also want to say that parliament does need to do something in relation to our records when there are members of parliament who have been here for over four and a half years who have drawn a salary for all of that time and who have spoken for less time than mr burke who has been in the parliament for six months
i think it is time we drew attention to this
there are people who do not participate in this parliament in its committees or in its plenary
some of them are members of small groups
they come in here and get speaking time before they rush off to the airport and spend their time in our national member states instead of being out here telling people how awful democracy is in the european union
well democracy is awful in the european union if members of this parliament who do not turn up here can be paid a salary to continue with this sort of flagrant abuse of democracy
i want to put that on the record mr president
i believe that when we are reforming when we are making documents available when we are ensuring that there is greater transparency we should take steps to show which parliamentarians are participating in the work of parliament and which are not
