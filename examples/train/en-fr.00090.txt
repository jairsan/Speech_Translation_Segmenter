can i support the last two comments in relation to an impact assessment
i would have thought there is much to gain from both the commission and council point of view if you have evidence that helps you through an impact assessment
i know the irish blight is a long-told story but it is a very significant problem and i think you need to address it not just from a producer perspective but bearing in mind that this has implications for food prices for availability and also that we are going to import a product that is produced using chemicals that europe will ban
tell me that makes sense because i do not see it
