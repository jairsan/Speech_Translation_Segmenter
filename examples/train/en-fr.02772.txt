madam president i have taken careful note of the opinions expressed during the course of this debate
i would like to thank honourable members for their views and assure them once again that the commission will continue to work with parliament member states and stakeholders from all sectors in pursuit of the common aim of moving forward as fast as possible with both proposals on novel food and cloning
i must stress that the position taken by the commission during the conciliation and we were advancing various proposals in this regard was that as i said before any solution or any compromise that could be reached had to be implementable
it would be possible to implement and it would be justified and proportionate
whatever all of us would like to have and as commissioner responsible for consumers i am all for information to consumers this must however be evidence-based and we must have an impact assessment
that was our position
the commission has never put forward a position against any type of labelling but we were saying that every decision we take has to be assessed to ensure the impact it is going to have on our citizens at large be they producers or be they consumers and that is the position that i still hold
i can assure you that the commission services and i will pursue this challenge with all determination and energy and i also assure you especially mr staes that i do not put off decisions that need to be taken
