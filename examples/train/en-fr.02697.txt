madam president i would say to the honourable members that the questions and specific cases that they have brought to our attention today are indeed very serious and are a black mark hanging over the developments which have taken place over the recent weeks in north africa and the middle east
i have taken note of the issues they have raised in this debate and of the suggestions made
as i said the european union has a number of instruments in place and will do everything to support greater participation of women in civil and political life free from threats intimidation and violence
i would also like to bring to members attention some positive recent developments such as the creation of a human rights office in the gulf cooperation council secretariat
we should welcome such steps
our support for international organisations not least united nations women and for civil society will be instrumental in supporting change from within
this also shows why our policy of dialogue and engagement is so important and must continue not least with our new interlocutors
