mr president it is odd is it not that as the schengen area comes apart in its core countries there are plans to extend it to include bulgaria and romania
there are over nine hundred zero gypsies in romania and bulgaria many of whom would like to migrate
once they can travel freely within the schengen area many of them will inevitably find their way to britain in order to take advantage of our generous benefits and public housing system like so many before them
perhaps some enterprising british citizens might like to meet the roma as they disembark at calais and heathrow and give them the addresses and location maps so that they can find their way to the homes of our prime minister his cabinet colleagues and all the mps in favour of eu membership
only when the roma pitch their caravans on the front lawns of our out-of-touch political class might they change their views on the benefits of eu membership
