mr president when we look at the poor state that we see many african nations in of course we in the eu and in the different member states of the eu all want to help them out of poverty but i think we should be more sensible about our use of aid
when there is a disaster it is absolutely right that aid plays a vital role in the short term but when we are looking at long-term development sometimes our aid is misallocated
surely it is not right for our taxpayers in different member states of the eu to be sending money to governments in africa who are not governing their country in a decent way and that money does not flow down to those who really need it
the best way to help development is to help the entrepreneurs in poorer countries who can create wealth in their own communities and take their own friends and neighbours out of poverty
let us open up our markets let us aim our aid at encouraging trade and development rather than just aid money
