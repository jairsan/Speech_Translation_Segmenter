madam president why does this report seek more international cooperation at university level
universities have shared information with each other for centuries before the eu existed
the renaissance spanning the fourteenth to seventeenth centuries was a surge in intellectual development spreading from florence right across europe through the universities
the arts music literature and the sciences became vibrant and spawned countless works which enrich us still today
so what of modernisation
do you look for the technological developments of the future
if so the scene today is just as promising
universities elsewhere may be overtaking us but they owe their beginnings to european universities
this tide of higher education often returns home
the universities of britain take postgraduate students from across the world pursuing their studies further and sharing their information not least with commerce and industry
but we do not need to politicise higher education through programmes such as the bologna and the erasmus processes
we do not need programmes on multiculturalism or multilingualism or any other -ism that will happen anyway as students from around the world meet and mix on campus
if you wish to serve the modern and future worlds see that universities are funded properly encourage those students who wish to study abroad then simply leave them all alone to get on with it
