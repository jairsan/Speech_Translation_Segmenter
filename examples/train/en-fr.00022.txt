madam president i rise not merely as a member of this house but also as a former schoolmaster
i wonder whether i might ask commissioner kallas at his next meeting with the council of ministers to have a particular word with the british minister of education to see whether or not it is possible that he might learn some of the lessons of the successes of the european school model
perhaps in particular he might consider reversing the disastrous decision of the british government to make the teaching of languages voluntary in other words dropping european languages from the british curriculum
secondly you might just remind him that europe was divided for half a century but that it has now been reunited for twenty years
perhaps he might consider suggesting to his curriculum advisers that they remind the next generation of the history and the culture of central and eastern europe in which britain traditionally was very much involved and did actually seek to support
