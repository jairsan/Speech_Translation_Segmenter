madam president those who pretend that an eu superstate is not being built before our eyes have a lot of explaining to do in terms of the contents of these empire building reports
affirmations that a common defence policy now taken as a given and what is called the eu's strategic autonomy require an integrated european armed force and demands for an autonomous and permanent eu operational headquarters along with demands for equivalence with nato leave no room for doubt but that under our common foreign and security policy those pushing the european project demand not just political power but also military power all of which must come from diminishing the powers the rights and the independence of the member states
such super-statehood and a centralised army for europe i repudiate as i do the lisbon treaty which would make it all possible
