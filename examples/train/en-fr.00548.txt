mr president although i support the aims of the proposals to simplify and clarify the requirements of the legislation and ensure better and more even implementation i have three primary concerns
firstly the commission has not only sought to simplify and ensure better implementation it has also greatly increased the scope in certain areas
i think there is a balance to strike between environmental protection on the one hand and on bureaucracy and cost to industry and smaller installations such as farmers and healthcare installations on the other
secondly the minimum requirements for large combustion plants present significant problems for parts of the uk power sector
i am told these concerns are shared by poland france italy spain and some eastern and southern member states
the requirements would mean that without a time-limited derogation the possibility for short-term continuation of national emissions reduction plans or energy security would be at risk
finally i am greatly concerned by and opposed to the european safety net
i do not think this is a good idea
i find that the minimum emissions limit values would become the default values rather than focusing on full application of the more ambitious best available techniques and could well reduce the level of environmental protection whilst at the same time vastly increasing the costs of implementation
i would ask all members to consider these points carefully before voting
