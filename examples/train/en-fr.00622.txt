mr president it seems that many on the other side are using the explanation-of-vote procedure on various reports to talk instead about the ratification of the lisbon treaty
in that they are making unfounded claims that the people have spoken against the lisbon treaty and that we do not want to listen to them
quite apart from the fact that it is up to member states not us to ratify the lisbon treaty this is of course totally wrong
one member state has said no we are listening and indeed we have to listen
the other member states have indicated they are willing to listen to the reasons for that no to take account of it and to move forward on that basis
but when mr dover does not even appreciate the difference between the constitutional treaty and the lisbon treaty and says that france and the netherlands rejected this treaty he conveniently forgets to point out those countries that had referendums to support the treaty
we do not just want to listen to one side of the argument
we want to listen to both sides and bridge the gap find a solution acceptable to every member state
they only want to listen to those people who vote no
it is they who are guilty of not listening to the peoples of europe
it is they who do not accept democratic results only the result that is convenient to them and not the overall situation of all member states
