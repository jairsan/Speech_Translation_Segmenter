mr president would the commissioner in her reply to parliament explain exactly how the newly phrased union for the mediterranean as opposed to mediterranean union remains an eu policy
i think it is very important that she also considers two other eu seas the black sea and its synergy and the baltic sea and its strategy
my country has an interest in the mediterranean
i think we have observer status too
member states are commonwealth members and though i do not wish to irritate my spanish colleagues gibraltar as far as i know still is technically part of her majesty's dominions
it is very important that this is not just some sort of regional hive-off in which the rest of the eu is not fully involved as i hope they will be fully involved in the baltic sea and the black sea
