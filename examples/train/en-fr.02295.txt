mr president i am alarmed by the use of criminal law against consenting same-sex relations taking place in private
this is already part of ugandan law and the punishment can be life imprisonment
however the bahati bill would make things even worse
the death penalty could be used while association and expression of lgbt issues would be effectively banned
the new bill will increase the climate of fear and hostility in a country where persecution of lgbt people is already under way
people would be required to report on each other on privacy matters
the lives of these people will be endangered
human dignity will have no meaning in uganda if such a law is adopted
we must not let this happen
