mr president a few weeks ago we discussed the report on totalitarian regimes
at the time i pointed out that there was indeed a common thread linking national socialism and soviet socialism and that was socialism itself
we know that the rapporteur mr corbett believes in the european project
he makes no bones about the fact that he believes in further political and economic integration he wants a united states of europe or a federal republic of europe
however in seeking to achieve these goals he is calling for the suppression of minority views and is almost single-handedly destroying the principle of freedom of speech
i know he does not care much for the principle of freedom of speech
looking at this report any evil dictator from the last century would have been proud to have mr corbett by their side
