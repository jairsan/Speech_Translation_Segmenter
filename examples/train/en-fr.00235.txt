mr president last monday during his visit to belfast president p√∂ttering enthused about the eu supporting what was euphemistically called a conflict transformation centre at the site of the former maze prison where some of the most vile and vicious terrorists were properly incarcerated
that was also where ten convicted ira terrorists committed suicide during their hunger strike
what the president perhaps did not appreciate is that because of this history irish republicans who love to wallow in self-pity are determined to effect their own transformation on any such centre and turn it into a shrine for some of the most evil terrorists known to this generation
hence the folly of the eu falling into the trap of funding such an obscenity and the foolishness of the president
