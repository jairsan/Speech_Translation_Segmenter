madam president the amendment to the regulation facilitates the exchange of information to manage legal and illegal immigration
i do not want to manage it i want to stop it
migration is based on the false assumption that we are the products of our culture and that exposure to european culture will transform non-europeans into europeans in the second generation if not the first
distinct peoples are not the product of distinct cultures distinct cultures are the product of distinct peoples
bring the populations of the third world into europe and you will be bringing the third world into europe not temporarily but for all time
that is what we have been doing for the last six decades
