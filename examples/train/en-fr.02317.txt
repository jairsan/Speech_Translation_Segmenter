madam president we agree with the general approach of yannick jadot to this issue
i welcome any agreement that guarantees protection of the rainforests of our planet if such agreements also advance the protection of the indigenous people of the forest and give a better life to the majority of the people in the countries concerned
it must be said at the start that both the republic of congo and cameroon have highly repressive governments
cameroon is very high in the corruption index kept by transparency international and in the republic of congo there has been horrific exploitation of some sections of the population notably the pygmy people although a new law has just been passed and people will wait to see what this does to protect indigenous people
the logging industry in these countries is implicated in corruption and in the exploitation of workers and the deforestation involved is a huge threat to the livelihoods of the indigenous people
it is for this reason that the original resolution of the european united left group calls for the logging industry to be in public ownership and under democratic control crucially involving workers in the industry and the indigenous communities in the forests affected by logging
the left's resolution also points out that illegal logging is related to poverty levels in the countries concerned
it can provide an income for individuals and their families who would otherwise go hungry and therefore ending illegal logging is also linked to ending the poverty and deprivation of many communities in the relevant countries
this will not be done by the corrupt local elites nor by european multinational corporations whose key motivation is private profit but by the forestry workers and the indigenous peoples themselves taking democratic ownership of their resources
in this sense the people of sub-saharan africa can take inspiration from their brothers and sisters in tunisia in their heroic struggle against a corrupt dictatorship over the past weeks
