madam president i have a confession to make
since i was a child there has been one vegetable that i hate peas
but i have the misfortune to represent britain's largest growing pea-growing area which has given me a huge problem with the breyer report
i agree with the aims of this report
i agree with the aims of the legislation to promote the health of our environment the health of us as individuals but it really potentially threatens a huge agricultural industry in my region
after much soul-searching i have abstained but i wish to make it clear that i think our legislative procedure in this respect was flawed
we had so much information at the end conflicting and otherwise that i and i think many others would have welcomed the possibility of a third reading or of conciliation to make sure that we have protected all interests
