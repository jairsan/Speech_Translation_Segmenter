mr president the title of this question speaks about improving the environment for smes
could i suggest that if the eu really wants to help rather than indulging in predictable rhetoric there is something meaningful and immediate which could be done
why could we not initiate a regulation holiday for smes during the current global crisis
compliance with tier upon tier of eu regulation is so demanding so onerous and so expensive that it is stultifying eu output and prosperity
the cost is unbearable
it amounts to billions per annum
at a stroke through a regulation holiday we could save businesses billions per year and allow them to grow
