madam president we have heard a lot of nonsense today about green jobs
the fact is that our obsession with renewables is already driving up the cost of electricity and forcing european citizens into fuel poverty
higher energy prices mean that energy-intensive businesses in europe will simply give up and go away to more favourable jurisdictions
higher energy prices mean lower growth and higher unemployment and they cost jobs
i have only seen one formal study into this question of green jobs
that was in spain and it demonstrated that for every single job created in the green sector two point two jobs were lost elsewhere
if we are really serious about low-carbon electricity there is only one solution and that is nuclear power
across europe we are starting to talk about new nuclear capacity and that is good
if we want to keep the lights on we need a nuclear renaissance and it we need it fast
