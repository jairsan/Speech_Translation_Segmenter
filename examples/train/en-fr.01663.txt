i understand that president barroso does not want to prejudge the outcome of the commission's consultation
however there are a number of people in the eu not least the three million people in the uk who currently take advantage of the opt-out who will be looking for a commitment from him that during an economic downturn his commission does not want to make it harder for people to work
i am afraid that commissioner andor did not give us that assurance at the time of his confirmation hearing but i trust that president barroso will now
