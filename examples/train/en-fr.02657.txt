madam president the eu tends to term what in many cases is fraud and corruption as errors
worse the commission has decided to move from zero tolerance to tolerable risk
to add insult to injury the recent revelations about members of this house who agreed to amend or write legislation in exchange for payment further erode the credibility of this parliament particularly in its efforts to fight fraud and corruption
only two of the four whose names were revealed have effectively resigned
will this parliament review the legislation these four meps have worked on
one mep has even gone so far as to question olaf's power to investigate these cases declaring incredibly that in some countries such action would not be considered illegal and would not even be investigated
this report should spur the british government to withhold all payments to the eu until fraud to use its proper name is meaningfully tackled by this parliament
