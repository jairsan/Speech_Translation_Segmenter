madam president it is untenable to say that the constitution of a member state is a matter only for itself
the treaties in articles six and seven make it crystal clear not only that the union and the member states share certain values but that the commission has the duty to police respect for those values
i wholly subscribe to what my colleague renate weber eloquently said i do think it a bit rich for those of the same political persuasion as the ruling fidesz party in hungary to accuse critics of that constitution of being politically inspired
many of the provisions of this constitution are very partisan such as the omission of protection of gay people from discrimination and the giving of extra votes to mothers
but i want to give a good example of one flaw in the constitution that undermines the treaty's insistence on the rule of law
this is the declaration that the nineteen forty-nine constitution is invalid
not just repealed but invalid
this creates great legal uncertainty as it leaves in limbo and apparently invalid themselves laws passed under that constitution including in respect of hungary's accession and eu membership
this is one reason why the commission should examine it for compliance with eu law and it could have a great effect on other member states
