madam president the main reasons for food inflation have been rising global commodity prices soaring energy prices and volatility within the marketplace and there is no doubt that the consumer is suffering
it is however the agricultural industry which has been dealing with this for some time as well as rising feed prices and rising fertiliser prices
profit margins have been reduced and many farmers especially those in the intensive sectors face financial ruin
i would ask parliament today to consider the consequences if we did not have support for farmers from the common agricultural policy
what would we be paying for food in that financial climate
i would also urge parliament to consider very strong support for the common agricultural policy in the very important debates that are coming up
it is important that we have a policy that will support farmers and ensure adequate food supply at a fair price
i would also say that fairness is absolutely essential and in fairness we need transparency within the food supply chain
this will only come particularly in the united kingdom if we have a supermarket ombudsman
