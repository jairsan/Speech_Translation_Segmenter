madam president i think we are forgetting that it was this parliament which first took up the campaign for an eu-wide ban on the cruel trade in seal products
in two thousand and six a written declaration calling for this ban was overwhelmingly backed by members receiving four hundred and twenty-five signatures with studies by veterinary experts clearly showing that seals are killed with terrible suffering often skinned whilst still conscious
the public no longer tolerate the trade and we as their representatives have the power to end it
moreover our vote tomorrow will be a decisive step forward in the global campaign to ban the trade
the usa has had a ban for many years
mexico has banned the trade
in europe we already have national bans in belgium the netherlands luxembourg and italy germany and the uk are considering ways to ban the trade
bans are now in place in russia
hong kong is planning a ban
this is a political issue that now has its time
after a forty year campaign against the trade europe has the chance to introduce a ban in all twenty-seven states
for the committee on internal market and consumer protection it is not the first time we have taken up citizens concern to end the cruel trade
parliament has the power to deliver for citizens and the internal market committee was determined to go for a strong ban whilst securing exemption for traditional inuit hunting
the committee rejected the commission's mixed proposal for a partial ban and labelling the committee rejected mrs wallis's proposal for a labelling option only
why
because citizens would have condemned this half-hearted gesture which would have allowed the cruel slaughter to continue
the public have demonstrated in numerous polls across european countries that they want an end to the trade seventy-five of people polled in the uk want an end eighty in austria over ninety in france and the netherlands
even in those countries in the eu where a small amount of traditional seal hunting takes place the trade is not supported by the public with seventy against in sweden
a clear majority of canadians do not support their country's hunt
furthermore eighty-six of canadian people polled believed the eu should be free to choose to ban these products
i have here a letter from a canadian senator written to president p√∂ttering saying your vote to ban the trade in seal products will help the vast majority of canadians who watched in admiration as the russian federation ended its bloody seal slaughter last month to force their politicians to look beyond political expediency to what is right and to end this inhumane hunt once and for all
on behalf of the majority of canadians who are opposed to the hunt thank you for the leadership you are taking on this issue
it is much appreciated
this year fifty zero seals have been slaughtered in the canadian hunt compared to two hundred and twenty zero last year
that means that we as citizens now have the opportunity to ban this cruel trade
i know that this will be applauded by the citizens of europe
i hope that parliament will tomorrow vote to back the internal market committee's proposal for a ban in seal trade products
