madam president contrary to the belief of the commission the debate regarding man-made climate change is far from over
in the past month alone we have had the scandal of the university of east anglia then we have had the debacle over the himalayan glaciers and now we have got questions over the effect climate change will have on wildlife in the amazon
research has shown that at least twenty passages in the ipcc's report cite non-peer-reviewed world wildlife fund or greenpeace reports as authority
this is not science
we need solid peer-reviewed scientific evidence not the work of pressure groups using climate change to further their own agendas or politicians who use climate change to justify the existence of the european union
i would like to ask whether it is now time to pause to take stock and consider the ramifications of bounding ahead with policies that could damage economies result in job losses or potentially result in energy chaos
