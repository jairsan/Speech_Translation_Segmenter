mr president i welcome the fact that this debate is encompassing all energy prices and not just that of oil which of course is a major concern
over the past year it is not only oil that has experienced a price shock the cost of coal and gas is rising just as fast as oil if not faster
as is always the case the consumers are the worst affected
spikes in energy prices put huge pressure on the budget of the average consumer
as representatives of the people at policy level it is up to us to implement policies that will ensure a sustainable fuel supply at a reasonable price
how can we achieve this as fuel wells <unk> approach depletion
we should be concentrating to an even greater degree on renewable energy and resources
we should increase study of and investment in alternative fuel sources
this is by no means a new idea yet to date we have not done enough in this regard
we have a duty to the european people and for the sake of our environment to turn our words into actions
environmental protection and consumer financial welfare are not mutually exclusive goals
by spending more money time and resources on the area of renewable energy we can achieve them both and can ensure a sustainable supply of energy for the future
