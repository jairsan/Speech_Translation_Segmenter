mr president the crass proposal by the commission in its original proposition that they should control recreational fishing and require returns and licensing and everything else that goes with such bureaucracy was one of the those proposals which quite rightly stirred huge opposition not just in that sector but amongst those who take an interest in matters pertaining to fishing and to eu bureaucracy
i am therefore glad that today amendment forty-eight has been approved
this at least goes some way to restoring the proper discretion of the member state as to whether to take any steps in relation to the licensing and the recording of recreational fishing leaving it to member states to judge whether there is any impact when in most member states there is not on the product of fish take from recreational fishing
so i am glad that the commission has been rebuffed on this proposition and that what started out as bad has been somewhat ameliorated
