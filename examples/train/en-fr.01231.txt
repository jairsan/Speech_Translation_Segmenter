mr president i have been a long-standing critic in this house of the lack of human rights in the people's republic of china
i have criticised the bullying of peaceful taiwan in excluding this country from all international organisations including the world health organisation
i have criticised the repression of peaceful tibetan culture the persecution of falun gong as well as other religious minorities and the presence of widespread censorship in china including the media and also the internet and google
i condemn as well the brutal and widespread use of the death sentence for lesser crimes such as economic subversion and pimping believe it or not
nevertheless my group the ecr regards it as a personal conscience matter whether the death sentence is justifiable in the most serious crimes of terrorism and murder
there can be no doubt that in the recent riots in xinjiang province many innocent han chinese were brutally murdered
nevertheless of course we do now welcome the prc's expressed desire for having much better and harmonious relations with its ethnic minorities and in particular the uighurs and other muslim minorities
of course i like all members of my group call for fair trials for all those detained
