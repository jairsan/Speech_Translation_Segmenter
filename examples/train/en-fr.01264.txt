mr president i agree with the israeli foreign minister mr lieberman that the final council statement is a lot better perhaps than the earlier swedish draft which i saw a couple of weeks ago but it makes no mention of the accepted quartet principles which hamas repudiates as it carries on terrorising palestinian authority officials and civilians alike in gaza
also why did foreign minister bildt not visit the region to show solidarity with democratic israel and moderate palestinians
also why was the annexation of east jerusalem singled out for mention at this critical time
the eu needs to be more balanced and formally recognise our common democratic values with the state of israel and actually enhance israel's participation in eu programmes unusually i agree with baroness ludford on this under the association agreement in order to build confidence by israel in the eu's goodwill towards the jewish state
