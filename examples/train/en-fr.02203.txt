on behalf of mr daul the chair of our group i want to ask the following question
the epp group would like to know your views pertaining to the current efforts to resume direct negotiations for the settlement of the palestinian question
the united states has abandoned efforts to convince israel to extend the moratorium on settlements in east jerusalem and the west bank probably because they are leading nowhere
what efforts are to be undertaken by the eu separately or in conjunction within the quartet to get the negotiations under way
in view of the present developments how should one read the reiteration of the eu's readiness to recognise an independent palestinian state when appropriate
what is the assessment of the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip after the decision taken by israel in june twenty ten to ease the closure of the crossings and the efforts for the liberation of gilad shalit
