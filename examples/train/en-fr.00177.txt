madam president i would first of all like to add my thanks to our rapporteur for all his hard work on this delicate subject
however despite his great efforts i am afraid that i and my national delegation cannot support this report
i believe that the cap is in need of radical reform
it needs to move away from the old direct subsidy route to a system that is market orientated and that values rural sustainability and the environment and recognises efficient farming instead of propping up inefficient farming
whilst this report in itself is not a major reform document it does set the tone for future reforms beyond twenty thirteen
that is why i am disappointed in the outcome of the vote in the agriculture committee which yet again it appears to me has resulted in that committee turning its back on a fundamental reform of this discredited system
in particular i highlight compulsory modulation
i cannot support a position that will see less money going to rural development and furthermore removes the need for member states to cofinance new modulation money
i also cannot support the committee view that we should also step back from full decoupling but i reserve my biggest fear for the commission
your position commissioner on compulsory modulation is right
your position on decoupling is right
for once we have a commission that seriously wants to reform the cap but faces a parliament that always fails to deliver on this issue and believes that the challenges we face could be solved by sticking to the old discredited system
hang tough commissioner you are right and sadly i suspect this chamber will be wrong
