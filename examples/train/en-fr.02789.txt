madam president the commission strategy on antimicrobial resistance amr which we plan to present in november will provide further ideas on how the commission together with the member states and stakeholders could tackle amr in all sectors involved
some of these actions may require changes in legislation
others may not
the key is to select the right tools for the task in hand
i fully agree with you that this is not only or chiefly an animal farming issue
this is why our aim is to reduce the development of antimicrobial resistance attributed to the use of antimicrobials in animals
there are various tools here education awareness-raising campaigns and so on
by the same token we believe that data has to be collected to promote better understanding of the problem
the member states do actually show interest in providing data which is encouraging
and yes we do have a timetable for action
preparatory work is ongoing including impact assessment the revision of rules on veterinary medical products and so on
legislative proposals as i already mentioned will follow in twenty twelve
the commission very much welcomes the valuable input of parliament and looks forward to continued collaboration with parliament member states and stakeholders from all sectors with the common aim of protecting the health of citizens throughout the european union
