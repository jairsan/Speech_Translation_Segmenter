initially i was a bit taken aback by the opening remarks of the commissioner but then he clarified the situation
i am quite happy as he says that the new commission can look at it
there are great opportunities there to develop tourism right throughout the european union and i am quite happy to work with the commission and to do anything we can because it is an opportunity
it is very important to show that the lisbon treaty works for people and that it creates jobs particularly in tourism so i am quite happy with the answer and there is no need for a further answer
