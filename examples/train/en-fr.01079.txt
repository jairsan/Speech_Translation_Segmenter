sport activity is subject to the application of eu law today and as the honourable member rightly points out when the lisbon treaty enters into force it will provide the eu with a legal basis allowing it to contribute to the promotion of european sporting issues while taking into account the specific nature of sport its structures based on voluntary activities and its social and educational function
however the council cannot take a view on the internal organisation of the next commission which in line with the treaty is a matter for the president of the commission
i agree that sport and health go hand in hand
sport activities also promote social cohesion democracy and personal development
sport is certainly also entertainment both when the local football club is playing and when there are international competitions
it is my belief that a free and independent sports movement also has a responsibility in societal matters such as public health and safeguarding democratic values
the swedish presidency regards sports policy first and foremost as a national issue
one also has to be cautious with new suggestions and programmes which expand policies at eu level in a way which could damage already well-functioning systems such as the ones civic society has built up over the years
