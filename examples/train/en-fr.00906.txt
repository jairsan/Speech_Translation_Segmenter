the commission is closely following the situation in venezuela with concern
the commission is aware of the case of manuel rosales
he was granted political asylum in peru after being charged with corruption in venezuela
the commission has taken note of the explanation provided by the president of rosales party according to which he has gone into hiding for his own protection
the commission believes that the request for asylum made by manuel rosales and its acceptance by the peruvian government is a bilateral case and that it is not for the commission to pronounce itself on the merits of this request
we are aware that recently the judicial institutions have opened some judicial processes against opposition leaders in venezuela
we know that some sectors of venezuelan society have criticised the proliferation of measures which they consider adversely affect the right to freedom of expression and the freedom to exercise political rights
this same sector considers that the government is showing an intolerant attitude towards criticism
we are conscious of these facts and we are closely following the political situation in venezuela
i would like to underline the importance that the european union attaches to freedom of expression and opinion a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of democracy and the rule of law
we hope that the democratic institutions of venezuela will respect the rule of law and preserve democracy in the country whilst complying with the obligation arising from the international agreements signed and ratified by venezuela including the american convention on human rights and specifically the provisions on political rights set out in article twenty-three
i wish to assure parliament that the commission will continue to follow developments in venezuela closely
the commission's commitment to supporting and strengthening democracy and the protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms will continue to be reflected in our cooperation policies and relations with venezuela
