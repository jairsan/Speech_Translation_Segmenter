madam president if turkey joins the european union it will be the poorest and most economically backward member state with a population of over seventy-two million people
hundreds of thousands if not millions of people will migrate to countries like britain
the european union will border countries such as syria iraq and iran with enormous potential for future conflict and confrontation
however the people who should really be worried about turkish entry are greek cypriots if turkey joins the eu the turks will have the right to go anywhere in the eu
thousands of turks will be able to legally go to southern cyprus and effectively occupy it quite legitimately if they so wish
in the european elections on four june voters of greek origin in london should remember that the conservative labour liberal democrat and green parties all enthusiastically support turkish entry
the only british party in the european parliament that opposes turkish entry is the uk independence party
