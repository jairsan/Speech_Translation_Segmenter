mr president i am glad the commission's twenty twenty energy strategy refers to the ongoing review concerning the impact of indirect land use change
it is vital the commission meets its obligation to come forward with a proposal on this by the end of this year both to allay widespread public concern that some biofuels currently on the market may not be producing a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and also for the sake of industry which is developing innovative processes whose added value deserves to be recognised
on that question of energy certainty i would also ask the commission to rethink its comments on the harmonisation of national support schemes for renewables
i am all for action at a european level when it adds value but member states have only recently brought out their national renewable energy action plans and are working to implement them this would be harmonisation too far
