madam president on the breyer report i say to the commission why are you against an impact assessment
what is so vital or of so much concern that the commission are opposed to an impact assessment
there is no scientific evidence to suggest that some of the products that we have been using are dangerous to public health
some of them are but there are quite a few you propose to take off the menu that are not dangerous
i am thinking particularly here of one called triasol which is vitally important to the production of wheat within the european union
you have failed and i mean this quite clearly you the commission have failed the general public when you failed to stop gmos coming into the european union and the commission admits this
you have admitted the fact that you have failed to stop gmos coming into europe
you failed when it came to the report that i did on maximum residue levels
we have a member here from dg sanco the commissioner is busy talking at the moment but when she has stopped talking she might just listen to what i have got to say
they have failed to control imports coming in with maximum residue levels of pesticides
they are being found on supermarket shelves
so if we are going to ban these products within the european union what are you going to do about the imports coming in
are you just going to say well it does not really matter these products are going to be coming in anyway
let us leave it and just assume that people will not bother about it
farmers throughout the european union have been the most responsible people when it comes to producing food and putting this legislation in place basically means saying to them that they are fools and they are not interested
no farmer in his right mind would use a chemical which is dangerous to public health
we have done a huge amount of surveys on this
i leave you with one or two last thoughts on this
we are about to ban battery cages for the production of eggs and yet you will give a derogation on that
yet that is fairly important to people
i worry about the fact that you the commission have failed so far to put in place all the legislation which we have
it is vitally important here that you give the farmers the opportunity to prove themselves and prove the fact that these products are safe
