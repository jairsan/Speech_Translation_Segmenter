mr president like my colleague michel barnier i find it very heartening to be part of such a lively debate and to hear such expert views relating to consumer issues
this augurs well for our working together in a true spirit of partnership and achieving our objective to put consumers first
if i may i will repeat one point i made in my initial address
in addition to the economic arguments for a strong effective and properly enforced consumer policy we should keep our sights firmly on the central role this can play in reconnecting europe with its citizens perhaps the biggest prize of all
i know that one of my main tasks is to coordinate this effort in the commission and your vigilance will be most welcome and comforting
the consumer scoreboard is a tool which enables us to detect failures in the market and allows us to move to a further study on how to address such failures
i believe that it is a crucial mechanism that serves a very real purpose and we can usefully benefit from its further development and strengthening
the scoreboard will be our eyes and ears alerting us to problem hotspots
a better reflection of the consumer angle across eu policies and our joint commitment to effective enforcement will result in a stronger eu consumer and the economic benefits that will follow
following a public consultation last year the commission is evaluating the comments about collective redress and intends to find a solution that meets european consumers needs without importing us practices
alternative dispute resolution is going to be our key mover in this regard
my friend michel barnier has already explained the central position that the internal market has in the eu twenty twenty strategy
if you look closely at the text there is a clear understanding also that consumers must remain at the heart of the single market
consumers are positioned as drivers of the single market and we intend to continue to consolidate the centrality of consumers
i see the issue of consumer education as a key issue for consumer empowerment
we are indeed looking at how our dolcetta programme can be further enhanced to cover new areas
on the last point raised about a european consumer agency it must be emphasised that enforcement is the exclusive obligation of the member states and they need to provide adequate resources for its proper functioning
however the treaty does provide a legal basis for the union to support and complement their efforts
it has to be carefully evaluated in what areas the eu can complement national public enforcement and what is the right institutional structure for that
the commission will carefully evaluate the different options
i very much look forward to making serious and sustained progress with you over the time i am responsible for this sector
