madam president the ppe-de group did not support jan andersson's report as originally drafted
however as the result of good work by our shadow working with other shadows to quite considerably rewrite the report we were comfortable with supporting it in committee
indeed our group will also be proposing to support it today in its current form
having said that there are certain amendments which we are also keen to see supported
hopefully he will give consideration to that on his side
i will just pick up on one very important point
stephen hughes referred to the fact which i am sure is true that there is widespread anxiety amongst trade unions regarding possible limitations on the right to strike
i would not argue with that but i hope he would not argue with me when i say that there is widespread anxiety amongst workers about potential limitations upon the right to work
i have not heard enough either in this debate or in the committee about that important right
of course the right to strike is a fundamental right that is not in dispute
but the right to work the freedom to work is also a very important right and that is something that on this side of the house we would like to see underlined
