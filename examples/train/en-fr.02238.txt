madam president this is no ordinary day for parliament
we should be proud of the historic step that has been taken today both on human trafficking and indeed on the european protection order
for the first time criminal law and all the tools we have at our disposal after lisbon have been brought into action on one of the most complex and horrific problems that we have to face collectively
we are proud in the s d group of the work done by anna hedh and her co-rapporteur ms bauer and we are proud of the firsts that are marked by this report
for the first time the eu will define in a binding legislative act a high level of sanctions against trafficking
for the first time there are strong guarantees concerning the protection of victims special attention for child victims the non-prosecution of victims who break the law due to their enslavement and the recognition of the role and support of ngos in the process
finally the complexity of this cause in relation to children and women because we were moving into criminal law should not have been a reason to stop a very good report
we are very proud in our group that this has happened across the house
it is a very proud day for the whole parliament
