i would also like to thank the honourable member for this question
it is clear he is trying to explore all possible avenues of how to help and improve the situation in this theatre
i have to start by underlining that community action in the field of culture is based on article one hundred and fifty-one which provides that community action shall be aimed at encouraging cooperation between member states and if necessary supporting and supplementing their action
however the decision on the allocation of national funds to cultural institutions belongs to member states and no community competence allows the commission to influence such choices
nevertheless intercultural dialogue and the promotion of cultural diversity are key objectives of the european cultural agenda and transnational projects in this field may therefore be eligible for community support under the culture programme
it aims more specifically at encouraging creativity and mobility of artists public access to culture the dissemination of art and culture intercultural dialogue and knowledge of the history and cultural heritage of the peoples of europe
only projects with a european dimension can be financed meaning at least three or in the case of multiannual projects six organisations from different member states must participate in the project
operating grants for a single cultural institution are only possible if the activities are carried out at european level in at least seven countries participating in the cultural programme
it should also be mentioned that the commission has developed a strategy to promote multilingualism in the european union which covers official national regional minority and migrant languages
the communication of september two thousand and eight multilingualism an asset for europe and a shared commitment confirms commission support for all languages spoken in the community including the languages spoken by minorities
this strategy is implemented in close cooperation with the member states who remain however the decision makers with respect to internal language policy
the promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is also one of the general objectives of the lifelong learning programme
under this programme the european union supports projects and networks to promote all languages present in the eu including minority languages
in addition to that it must be stressed that the protection of persons belonging to minorities is one of the principles on which the union is founded
therefore the commission considers that member states must use all available legal instruments in order to guarantee the rights of individuals including those belonging to national minorities and act proactively against all sources of discrimination
the european commission reaffirms its commitment to the protection of fundamental rights and non-discrimination
