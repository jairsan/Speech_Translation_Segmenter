madam president we female meps are definitely in a minority position
we have satisfying and stimulating work with equal pay equal pensions equal access to positions of responsibility so very different from so many of our constituents
i welcome this report and applaud the emphasis that mr tarabella puts on the economic well-being of women
i think this is the single most important factor in promoting gender equality
if women control their lives economically they are much better able to control all other aspects of their lives
we must ensure that in these challenging economic times women are not left behind in low-paid low-security jobs
i would like to congratulate the european engineering industries association for their recent policy vision in which they ask for the promotion of maths and science studies especially for women
they want and i quote to bring in in much greater numbers skilled women who have for too long shunned many areas of engineering
yes the position of women is about policies it is about direction but it also about action action which speaks louder than words
this is the way forward with enlightened employers recognising women's strengths and promoting their economic well-being
