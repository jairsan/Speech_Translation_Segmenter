madam president before we bid goodbye to guantánamo by a combination of a resolution of this parliament and the executive decision of the president of the united states a wicked combination of naked power let me just put on record two facts
first of all guantánamo was set up in order to protect all of our citizens
as far as the united states was concerned it worked
since nine eleven there has not been one single act of terrorism on the united states mainland
as he goes into retirement let us salute the record of president george w bush as far as that is concerned
i realise i have spoken the ultimate heresy in this house by saying it but it is true
secondly let us remember too that although we have been pretty free with our advice to the americans let us see what europe does now to take the burden-sharing of some of these prisoners and protecting our people from future terrorist attack
i will not be holding my breath
