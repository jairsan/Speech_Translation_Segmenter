madam president i would like to thank the ombudsman for his work
he has a very specific job to do namely maladministration and therefore it is important that citizens understand what that term means
much of what i am about to say does not directly impact on the ombudsman but i think it needs to be placed on the record
some of the biggest problems and complaints we get are about our own member states
citizens then complain as mr busuttil said directly to the commission who under this pilot scheme go back to the member state to try to have the matter resolved when the citizens themselves have failed
that mechanism is not transparent and needs to be looked at
we need a discussion on it in this house
the second issue which arises relates to property purchases and transactions between citizens in different member states
we have no remit in this area but it is a growing concern and we need to address it in some way
lastly the irish ombudsman has issued two reports which our own government have rejected
it is of deep concern that an ombudsman in any member state would have their work literally torn up
you are aware of that mr ombudsman
i am glad that you are nodding approvingly
this must be addressed
it cannot be allowed to continue
