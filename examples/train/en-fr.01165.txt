madam president in my english constituency this week it was discovered that scientists from the university of east anglia were allegedly manipulating data to try and prove man-made global warming
what a giveaway that was it is clear now that the scientific consensus on man-made global warming is fast eroding thirty zero sceptical scientists in the manhattan declaration six hundred scientists in a us senate report even german scientists this year writing to chancellor angela merkel
meanwhile the author of the key un report on this sir nicholas stern urges us to become vegetarian to stop cows farting
maybe it is not just certain cows that have gone mad
i am on the committee on international trade
i am deeply concerned with the wto talks starting this week
i worry about a drift towards green tariffs justified on the basis of such spurious claims
these new tariffs are just barriers to trade they punish the poor and have no justification whatsoever
this is just enviro-imperialism
