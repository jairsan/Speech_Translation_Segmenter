mr president the first note of dissension this morning these reports wholeheartedly support the implementation of eu laws on consumer protection in member states and the monitoring of the integration process of markets which will be reported on in an annual report
one of the main recommendations is the establishing of a consumer markets scoreboard concerning topics such as complaints prices satisfaction switching and safety plus a whole host of additional long-term indicators
the commission intends to carry out in-depth analysis of all so-called problematic sectors identified in the consumer markets scoreboard
this bureaucratic web of interconnecting enforcements and self-perpetuating regulation will do for the small-business retail trade in britain what the common fisheries policy has done for the british fishing industry it will kill it
yet again the small-business entrepreneur is being targeted and disadvantaged by bureaucratic interference and overregulation
however well-intentioned these proposals are and i am sure they are yet again this is an eu solution desperately looking for a problem
