madam president travellers whose holiday plans have been ruined by the volcanic ash face confusion over insurance
although airlines will refund or rebook flights under the air passenger rights directive many passengers face the cost of hotel rooms and car hire and perhaps alternative flight arrangements but some travel insurance policies are expected to pay out for the losses
there are others claiming that this is an act of god but i would call on these companies to be pragmatic to be reasonable and to reconsider that decision bearing in mind that i like many others have numerous constituents who are at airports in various parts of the world costing them money that they do not have
i understand that the package travel directive is being reviewed and this must be done urgently
in conclusion it is essential that this travel directive ensures that there is a standard set of rules which applies to a situation of this kind
even at this stage i would ask the commission to look at this
