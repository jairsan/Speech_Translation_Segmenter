madam president britain is not signed up to schengen so technically this proposal should not apply to the uk
the old labour government did not opt in and the new lib-dem con coalition government must stay opted out
such a scheme would merely encourage more refugees genuine or not to come to the european union
imagine if turkey joins the european union we can expect not just seventy-two million turks to have automatic right of entry to european countries and britain but floods of refugees from places such as iran and iraq might cross the border into turkey and then seek resettlement in europe britain does not have to join this scheme but watching our new government grapple with such issues will be interesting
one half of it the conservative party pretends to be eurosceptic whatever that means while the other half the liberal democratic party is unreservedly europhile
however our new prime minister mr cameron can solve such problems at a stroke as i described here yesterday
the increase in the numbers of members of this place requires a complete re-ratification of the lisbon treaty
mr cameron can simply choose not to re-ratify it or he can belatedly uphold his cast-iron guarantee and give the british people the referendum on the lisbon treaty that they were denied
