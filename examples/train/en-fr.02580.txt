mr president i do not accept this big crisis idea
i have been very clear with you mr cohn-bendit about exactly what my mandate is
the recognition of a government is the recognition that is given by the european council
the mandate of the high representative is to come forward with the ideas that are put to her to discuss those with the institutions beforehand and to put forward on friday to the european council the views that are being expressed
it is for the member states to take the decision
i will go from this to discuss with the president of the european council whose representative is here and i will discuss this with the president of the commission
we will also take the views through the institutions ready for friday and the foreign affairs council which meets tomorrow
i am not avoiding that but it is absolutely right and proper that member states take the decision on recognising a government
i hear very loudly what parliament says
let this not be a crisis
i am not avoiding anything
i am simply telling you that the way we should do this is to do it properly for the benefit of these people and the people of libya
