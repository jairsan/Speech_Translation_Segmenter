mr president the theory of a tobin tax has been around for years the idea of a global tax on foreign exchange but of course it has never seen the light of day
what is being proposed here and of course it is because the european union is so desperate for money and is in so much trouble that it needs its own resources is to use an opportunity to bash the financial sector because they are very unpopular at the moment and to introduce a financial transaction tax just in the european union as if somehow that will gain us great revenue
i am sorry but we are living in a global economy
if we become uncompetitive through tax or regulation people simply move and they can do so in the space of twenty-four hours
to do this would be to pursue kamikaze economics
the biggest foreign exchange market in the world the biggest financial sector in the world is in london
if i did not know better i would think perhaps there was a plot afoot here to stop the anglo-saxons going on doing all of their business
in twenty ten as a result of the aifm directive one in four hedge funds left the city of london
if we continue down this route britain will have lost its biggest single industry
i think the time has come when the city of london and britain's financial markets are going to rise up against membership of this european union
maybe if we vote for this tomorrow it will be so bad that it will be really rather a good thing for ukip and our view that we should not be part of this massive socialist experiment
