madam president i do not claim to be particularly with the intricacies of this situation but i do recognise the strategic importance of pakistan
for that reason i support the point made by mr karim that it is in everybody's interest to have a stable regime there in a region of great volatility
i also have to say that a union which was founded on the principles of peace and prosperity for our citizens should be in the vanguard of bringing peace and prosperity to other parts of the world so i support the proposals here this evening but i would like the commission to answer very fully the points made by mr higgins and others on the left
can they guarantee that the aid we would be giving would be going to those who deserve it and not to big traders and landlords
that is the key question this evening
