madam president again we are here having a debate about farmers incomes being destroyed by markets that are to be quite frank slightly dysfunctional in make-up and also cannot cope with major shocks like the grain price hike we are seeing
surely it is time our farming and market system was stronger and i hope the commission and the commissioner notice yet again that the political groups in this house are further calling for an adequate cap budget post twenty thirteen
the costs of inputs and overbearing regulations are making eu farms uncompetitive and the viability of our farm sector is deteriorating
our grassland system of quality and environmentally sustainable beef production is being undercut by third country imports
we must give our farmers a fair chance and in my experience that is all they want
the eu's lack of self-sufficiency in grain is becoming a serious issue not just for the beef but also for the pig and poultry industries
this motion is a statement of the seriousness with which this house takes ongoing developments in our agricultural markets
we as a parliament must intervene when we feel the situation is urgent and to be quite frank commissioner our beef poultry and pig sectors immediately need positive intervention
i look forward to your response
