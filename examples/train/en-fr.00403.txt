mr president has the commission considered the human health implications of poor implementation of animal welfare regulations
transport especially transport over long distances with a lack of space produces stress and stress means more susceptibility to disease
this is particularly true for horses where scientific studies show that transport makes horses become shedders
that means they excrete a lot more than they would normally which greatly increases the likelihood of the spread of disease
many transported animals are going to slaughter three hundred and twenty million of them in the eu each year so that means there is a greatly increased risk of diseases like salmonella entering the food chain
given the very poor level of implementation of current rules and the stress involved in long journeys even with proper rest stops especially for horses does the commission plan to come forward where necessary and on the basis of scientific evidence with a finite absolute journey time limit
that would be in the interests of animal welfare and of human health
