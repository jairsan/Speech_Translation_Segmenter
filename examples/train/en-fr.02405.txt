madam president in discussing the black sea area one word leaps to mind and that is caution
all must tread carefully here
the black sea area is russia's backyard
it has its fleet anchored in the crimea at sebastopol close to the bloody battlefields of the crimean war
we have seen the unfortunate conflict in georgia where there was fault on both sides
had georgia been in nato the consequences could have been disastrous
whilst i support georgian independence it is unwise to goad the russian bear in its own lair
then there is turkey which the eu is playing with by offering membership despite the reality that members such as france will veto an application
turkey has just four of its landmass within europe
it should not be in the eu
there are real dangers in leading turkey on
disappointment could drive turkey into the hands of islamic extremists
finally underlying all of this is the fact that the black sea is the hub for vital caspian oil and gas
tread carefully indeed
