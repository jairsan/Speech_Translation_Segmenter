mr president societies in africa are in general socially conservative
in many african countries sadly homosexuality is indeed outlawed
many people in africa feel threatened by efforts to promote homosexuality particularly when those efforts are led by ngos and organisations based in the west
there is a widely held perception in some parts of africa that liberal democracies are trying to push their own more tolerant values on societies with very different and ancient traditions
but be that as it may it does not excuse or justify the rampant homophobia that exists widely in some parts of africa
sadly this homophobia is often stirred up by governments and their media mouthpieces
uganda is yet again in the news for the extremism and hysteria of some of its legislators
they are supporting a bill that would impose the death penalty or life imprisonment on homosexuals depending on the nature of their so-called crime
i like the ecr group reject this draconian bill which would be an atrocious violation of individual rights and call on president museveni to veto it
uganda is a country in which the majority of people survive on a dollar a day surely the country's legislators can find better ways to serve the interests of ugandan society than to make gays subject to criminal prosecution
