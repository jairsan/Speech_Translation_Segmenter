madam president the socialist group is concerned about the human rights situation in china
while we recognise that the situation has improved significantly over the last ten years there are still many areas where human rights are still not properly or adequately protected
there may be a degree of freedom of thought but there is not freedom of action
we would certainly highlight the failure to allow free trade unions to operate within china
we are concerned about the plight of the one hundred million migrant workers who have moved from country to city and who have the most limited access to health and education
we are concerned about the plight of religious and ethnic minorities across the whole of china
nevertheless the socialist group was opposed to this debate and resolution
the reason was proportionality
it is right to criticise china for its human rights record as we criticise the united states for its use of the death penalty guant√°namo and extraordinary rendition but we do not have to do it every part-session
frankly it is becoming counterproductive
at one time the chinese authorities paid heed to our resolutions but no more
as some individuals and groups in their desperate attention-seeking continue to up the ante with today a demand i think for the first time that member states should abrogate the one-china policy and recognise the tibetan government-in-exile
the dalai lama was here only in december speaking on behalf of tibet in the plenary
why is it necessary to revisit the issue again
there is nothing new in the resolution
i along with elmar brok philippe morillon and other members of this parliament had the opportunity last summer to visit lhasa
we were the first international group to travel there after the troubles in march and spoke both to the authorities and those who were sympathetic to the tibetan protesters
as i wrote afterwards the reality was that peaceful protests and we support peaceful protest turned into race riots when shops homes and han chinese were attacked and burned with dozens of deaths
schools suffered arson attacks and hospitals and mosques of the muslim minority were attacked
the dalai lama himself recognised the reality of the situation when he threatened at the time to step down as a living god
china has done an enormous amount for tibet in terms of providing infrastructure like the new qinghai lhasa railway and higher levels of social provision than elsewhere in rural china
the problem is it is beginning to be resented elsewhere within china
but the problem is to quote the beatles money can t buy you love
tibetans still want a degree of cultural and political autonomy far beyond that which china is prepared to grant
as i said at the time china needs a dialogue with representatives of tibet to find a solution that grants that autonomy while protecting minority rights of ethnic and religious groups in the province
the alternative is that impatient young tibetans will turn to violence and terrorism
as a result of the article i wrote at the time i was asked to discuss the matter with dalai lama's representative in london which i did at some length
i agree with the commissioner it is through dialogue and engagement that we will find a way forward not through shrill endlessly repetitive rehashed resolutions such as the one we have here today
