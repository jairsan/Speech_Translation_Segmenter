mr president we too in the socialists and democrats want to fight for the european citizens and we want to fight against terrorism so that is why we will be recommending as my leader said a no vote tomorrow to ensure that we vote in this parliament on the first consent procedure under lisbon against a bad agreement for this whole parliament
this is not a sectarian issue for us but a factual issue
this is an issue about whether a badly drafted agreement serves the interests of security and anti-terrorism
as one of my advisers once said and he is a lawyer i used to be a lawyer and mr kirkhope was also a lawyer quoting benjamin franklin he who would put security so far before liberty deserves neither
so we all agree that for the eu citizens a good agreement is what we want
now in coreper it is absolutely true that the council came up with all the issues that we as a group regarded as the important issues
mrs clinton too in her letter acknowledged that parliament had a point but neither of these documents went further and gave us a blueprint for solving this problem and that is why a no will in our view push towards a better agreement for the whole parliament
so we in our group are appealing across the house and not just within our group to support the rapporteur in what she is trying to do a better agreement to fight terrorism
no one has the moral high ground here we want an effective fight against terrorism that means a better agreement and that is what we will be recommending to the socialist and democrats this evening in our group
