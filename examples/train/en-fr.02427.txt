mr president i am sorry to take up members time
resolutions were tabled because the committee was not satisfied with the institutional procedures and wished to obtain assurances from the commission and the presidency
in debate yesterday and in written statements and letters to me suitable assurances have been given and these will all be published
the majority recommendation of the committee now is to approve all the candidates with which i personally agree
that means voting against all the resolutions
there were four areas in which we sought assurances
concerning the independence of the authorities both the commission and the presidency have reaffirmed respect for the provisions of independence of the authorities their chairs executives and board members
concerning board representation the commission is being vigilant concerning the designations by the heads of the supervisory authority to the boards of supervisors as required by the regulation and the presidency supported the commission statement
concerning adequate budgetary resources the commission has recognised the need to provide adequate budgetary and human resources to the authorities with which the presidency has agreed and further stated the importance of fulfilment by member states of their obligations
concerning the appointment procedure we have all discovered we are bound by regulations in ways that all sides realise is inappropriate such as the retirement age criteria projected to the end of the term of office and also on the gender issue
these will be addressed in the review with which the commission and the presidency also both agree
the committee continues to insist on a role in the ongoing and future shortlisting procedures for all positions such as that of executive director
for democratic purposes members wish to be able to express a preference on individual candidates and so the resolutions have been kept on the agenda for voting
however as i say if you want to approve the appointments with which i concur then you should vote against the resolutions
