i will be brief as i realise there is very little time
commissioner i have to say that the implementation of the rights we have are frankly a joke at the moment
i was recently in amsterdam and watched klm dealing with delayed passengers by rebooking them on a self check-in
the staff systematically without asking the passengers declined the compensation and assistance which they were entitled to
can we have some monitoring by the commission
can we have some people actually at airports looking at what the airlines do
because frankly it seems to me that it has become a joke
