absolutely not
i think it is a very good initiative that aims precisely to restore some confidence in what is a very important sector of our financial markets
i think it is in the interests of the financial sector to have credibility
let us be honest and open about it
there is now a problem of credibility in the financial sector and it had its origin in let us say irresponsible behaviour of some major players in that sector not only in britain as you said but in other countries in europe apart from the situation that originated in the united states
we need a proper level of regulation
we believe that the regulation we have put forward is the appropriate balance and it does not aim at creating difficulties for the financial sector
on the contrary it aims at building trust
the financial sector needs this kind of credibility to finance the economy
