madam president i thank the commissioner for her lengthy and full statement
like many here in this chamber tonight commissioner i have been a little bit mystified by your acceptance that there is nothing that we can do in relation to the import of meat from third world countries
just earlier in your statement you said that just as third countries cannot impose standards in the eu so the eu cannot impose standards on other countries
now for many of our farmers that would seem an unfair position to have and i would respectfully suggest tonight that yes we can impose standards until we are sure
and until we get food and veterinary reports that actually tell us that there is compliance with the regulations that we have looked at then we should not import beef from those countries
many of our farmers are suffering under the huge strain of production and feel the unfairness and i think that you can hear in this chamber tonight the anger that many feel in relation to this particular issue
