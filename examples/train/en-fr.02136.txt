mr president this weekend a delegation from the commission and the imf went to dublin to give economic advice
another european country has yet again had to come up with a new national budget and for our friends across the irish sea it is an extremely difficult time
there is of course a deep irony in european officials opining on a national budget when the eu's own budget is not yet agreed
for many months my group has warned that with member states facing such budget pressures at home it is vital that the eu show restraint in its own spending ensuring that every penny of taxpayers money is well spent
the last vote in the european parliament did not show such restraint and it is of course a good sign that there is now agreement on the numbers between parliament and the council though i think we could have gone even lower
it is depressing however that despite agreeing the numbers there is still no agreement on the budget
our markets are still far from stable markets are nervous when there is uncertainty and i would urge members of this parliament to put aside political ambitions and get a budget agreed
