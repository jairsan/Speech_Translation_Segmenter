mr president thank you for giving me the opportunity to offer my explanation of vote
just like the last speaker i do not think anyone can disagree with the goals of the report in terms of promoting social inclusion and combating poverty
but what we really need to recognise is that we must get away from this idea that whatever the problem the solution is to be found at the eu level
actually the solution is often not even to be found at a national level
if we really want to tackle poverty if we really want to encourage social inclusion quite often we have to look to the solutions within our own communities
right across the european union right across my own country right across the city that i represent london the greatest city in the world we see a number of local community groups tackling poverty at the coalface without any intervention from the state
they understand the problems and the communities are acting together
we have to create the right conditions for local communities to tackle these problems if you want to look for the solutions please go to the website of the centre for social justice in my constituency in london
