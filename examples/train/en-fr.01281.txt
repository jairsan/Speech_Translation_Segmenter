madam president i think there are certain things to be welcomed in the action plan but as colleagues have correctly pointed out there are a number of questions there that have not been answered
i think that when we are looking at this we are always looking at it from the point of view of the problem that we have and sometimes tend to underestimate the daily reality for people in both afghanistan and pakistan of the many deaths the targeted killings of the hazara population for example in parts of pakistan the attacks on girls <unk> on the police and so many others
the afghan police were described to us recently as basically cannon fodder for the taliban
i think many of us are still wondering really what it was that we ever thought we would achieve by going in
in terms of the international response i welcome hearing the commissioner talking about kick-starting cooperation and particularly mentioning india
the regional approach is important and i look forward to hearing how we are going to deal with other areas of real tension such as kashmir which the afghan ambassador told us the other day really provides a problem for everything that people try to do in the region
we also need in pakistan particularly to be looking at what effective support we are offering in terms of the many thousands of displaced people and learn from our lack of engagement with those who were displaced to the borders of pakistan and afghanistan in the past that a vacuum will be filled
therefore we really need to be paying attention to education and meeting the needs of the population who are also looking after those displaced people
