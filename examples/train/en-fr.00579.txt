madam president i wish to thank you for a very concise but important debate and congratulate mrs neyts-uyttebroeck on her report and initiative
the icty is indeed an expression of european values of justice and the rule of law and therefore this debate is so important
it is also an essential element of our enlargement policy in the western balkans
on dates i can only agree with the icty itself that the dates in the tribunal's completion strategy are target dates only and not absolute deadlines as correctly stated in mrs neyts-uyttebroeck's report
for the commission the crucial issue is retaining the support of the international community for the completion of the tribunal's existing mandate so as to ensure that there will be no impunity for war crimes in the future
