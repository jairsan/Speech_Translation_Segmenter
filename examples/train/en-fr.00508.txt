mr president the international political military economic and financial architecture is under pressure due to the current crisis
the eu is a central part of this architecture
it appeared as the only formula for europe to preserve its role in the bipolar world
it enlarged successfully to reunite the continent at the end of the cold war and now it is called upon to preserve previous achievements and continue integration once better times come again
it is not an easy task particularly for the current presidency but also for the coming ones which will have to deal with the continuing institutional impasse over the lisbon treaty and transition to a new parliament and commission while fighting protectionist tendencies threats to renationalise common policies and potential international crises in our neighbourhood
the eu is therefore at a crucial moment
it can either make it or break it
our success will depend on complete understanding that solidarity is the only way in which we can face off all these great challenges and continue our odyssey in world affairs
