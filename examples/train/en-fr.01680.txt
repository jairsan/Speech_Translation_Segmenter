madam president honourable members i am pleased to be back at the european parliament and i am looking forward very much to this debate on relations with latin america
i would like to begin by thanking mr salafranca for his excellent report
i think it illustrates very well the convergence of views between our two institutions on the importance of and as he has rightly said the prospects for the european union's partnership in this region
i welcome very much the commitment of parliament to strengthen relations with latin america including through the interparliamentary dialogues
our joint efforts are central to developing a consistent policy and a strong presence in the region
i agree that the upcoming summit is a good opportunity to reiterate our commitment to the region and our determination to deepen the partnership
as the report rightly points out the partnership has been a success
today the eu is latin america's second-largest trading partner and the biggest investor in the region
we are expanding our cooperation beyond economic issues to cover key strategic issues climate change non-proliferation tackling drugs the promotion of peace and security worldwide
with this in mind the commission last year set out its strategy for latin america in the communication called the european union and latin america global players in partnership
our main conclusions were to step up the regional dialogue and support regional integration to strengthen bilateral relationships taking into account the diversity of the region and to adapt cooperation programmes to make them focused and results-oriented
i am pleased we have taken a number of initiatives since then
we have worked very closely with brazil and mexico on strategic partnerships and with chile on the association for development and innovation
with peru and colombia we have completed negotiations on a multi-party trade agreement and we expect to complete negotiations for an association agreement with central america in the near future and are working to resume negotiations with mercosur
we have intensified our policy dialogues on a range of issues sustainable development migration and the fight against illicit drugs
these are important negotiations and dialogues
they strengthen our relationship
there is also much that we can do in practice on regional integration
it is very important that the combined weight of the eu and latin america is able to focus on priority areas
with regard to the summit i agree very much that this is an important occasion
we want to have an action plan that covers cooperation on key issues science technology and innovation environment climate change and so on
secondly we want to acknowledge the progress that has been made with the various subregions and strengthen bilateral partnerships
thirdly as mr salafranca said we want to launch the investment fund and to establish the eu-latin america and caribbean foundation
we are working hard to strengthen those relationships between the european union and latin america in what is of course a fast-changing world and where we can maximise the potential that we have
i am very keen to hear views from members of this house and to respond to any questions
