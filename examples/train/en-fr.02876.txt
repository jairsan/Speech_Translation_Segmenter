mr president the position regarding the uk government with regard to both the european arrest warrant and the european investigation order is that clearly they feel they have an obligation quite rightly to do what is best for the uk in relation to cross-border crime
we have been the victims of an enormous amount of crime and terrorism in particular as the honourable gentleman is aware
i am sure that he would share with me our determination to stamp out this crime and working together across borders is the best way to achieve it
of course the european investigation order needs careful implementation
but merely opting into it and to the concept of it as has been done by the government is not of course the final shout
what we need to see here is the detail of this order we need to implement it effectively and make it work well alongside the arrest warrant
but the fact that we have opted in is a good indication that we are determined to deal with cross-border crime
i trust the honourable gentleman shares our wishes in that regard
