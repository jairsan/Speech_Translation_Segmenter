thank you president-in-office malmstr√∂m for your considered reply
according to the communication from the commission in two thousand and eight the right conditions have to be put in place in terms of resources training and support for carers
i absolutely agree that this is so and i also understand that this is a national competence
there are however some areas where the eu can help
one of them is in the whole area of the cross-border dimension
i just wanted to know your opinion on the setting up of a formal structure for exchange of information with regard to health professionals in this case care-givers who cross borders
