i am aware that there have been concerns at some point that access to the polish ports concerned would be restricted
according to the information available to the commission however the german stralsund mining authority included a requirement for the nord stream company in its permit to prepare a revised risk analysis for a section of the pipeline in german territory as plans were presented at that stage by the polish side to adapt both ports for ships that would need a deeper water depth to float
as a result of the analysis the pipeline will be laid in the seabed with a covering of half a metre for about twenty km
in addition the analysis of the planned route of the german eez led to the decision to opt for an alternative track over a length of twelve km
the final permission was granted by the federal office for shipping and hydrography in february this year
according to the information available from the german authorities and the developer both of the above measures were taken in order to ensure unrestricted access to the polish ports after construction of the pipeline
i am sorry that this is very technical but it is the best information we have
