mr president treaty change is a sensitive subject in my member state where despite promises the lisbon treaty was passed without a referendum
but i understand why the crisis in the euro area is prompting you to establish a permanent stability mechanism and although the uk is not a member of the euro area we do wish to see your economic success
for these reasons my government has said that it will not block the treaty change required to establish the mechanism
but this resolution goes further and we know from history that introducing vague language leads to uncertainties
the recitals raise the concept of eurobonds woolly-worded and with no details
members from my group are concerned
does this hand over the sovereign right to manage one's own treasury
what about moral hazard issues
to summarise we will not vote against the treaty language agreed by member states which is specifically to enable this mechanism to be created but we cannot support this resolution with creeping vague concepts
