mr president terrorism is defined as the use of violence and intimidation to achieve political ends
those of us who value peace freedom and democracy ought to be concerned about terrorism because it works
sinn f√©in ira now hold posts in the government of northern ireland
they bombed shot and murdered their way to success at the ballot box
what better examples of successful terrorism are there than those of communism in russia eastern europe and asia
china is still terrorised by the chinese communist party after sixty-one years of power
no greater example of successful terrorism exists than that
the european commission which this parliament voted in yesterday contains communists former apparatchiks of brutal communist regimes in eastern europe and their fellow travellers
and of course the president of the european commission mr barroso is a former maoist
no doubt future terrorists will find this all extremely encouraging
