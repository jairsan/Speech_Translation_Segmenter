mr president i welcome and voted for the commission work programme for twenty eleven
the financial crisis is the big challenge and it has to be met head on
i wish the commission well in terms of the goals that it has set out
as regards the euro it is absolutely crucial from the point of view of the integrity and the cohesion of the union and from the point of view of solidarity within the european union that we have the common currency and that we do everything possible to protect it
as regards jobs and the economy i welcome the fact that in january twenty eleven the commission will adopt its first annual growth survey
that annual growth survey will analyse the economic situation of the union including potential imbalances and systemic risk
this is essential to europe's transformation into a smart and sustainable economy
last but by no means least we are a community of five hundred million people
we have got to punch above our weight on the european stage and the world stage internationally
i wish the commission well in the year ahead
