i merely want to thank the commissioner his predecessor and his officials who worked very closely with the irish officials both in brussels and in dublin and in particular her finance minister who signed off as you said almost on the last hour
while it is small it is very much appreciated thirty million that we might not have had
but i would also like to think that you might recommend to your colleagues that we should possibly change the threshold because the threshold in ireland is almost one billion and of course we were a long way below that
