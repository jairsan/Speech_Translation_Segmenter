madam president my contribution today will be one that highlights the need for investment investment in jobs investment in our environment and investment in all our economies
in that regard investment in our transport infrastructure and in particular in our railway infrastructure is crucial not only in providing us with a world-class rail network but also in protecting and creating jobs and social cohesion
let us prioritise the electrification of our rail network giving us both transport and environmental gains
let us invest in our tens transport network
let us have a recovery plan with substance and with action and not just words
doing nothing and letting the markets decide has failed
the time for concerted european action is now based on putting people first and vested interests last
we on this side of the house are not prepared to play pontius pilate washing our hands of the problem
we want to act and we want to act decisively
