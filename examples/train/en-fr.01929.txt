thank you commissioner for your rather broad answer
i did read all of those details in the communication
my question was more specific
citizens have read of this possibility of sanctions
how can you penalise member states and their governments without penalising their citizens
i think that is the core of my question
if you are going to stop the eu budget flowing to member states to the cap or to cohesion the question is who will suffer from that decision
you need to clarify that point in the chamber this evening
