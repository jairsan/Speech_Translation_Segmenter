madam president commissioner reding's record on non-discrimination is exemplary and the two testimonies she has heard tonight are intensely interesting
like mr de jong i am a gay man in a civil partnership in a relationship of twenty-seven years that has only been recognised by the state for five years
as was said earlier if i were to have an accident whilst on holiday in italy my partner would not even be given the basic right to decide whether in such a case i should be on a life support machine or not
it is these basic elements that are so private and personal of which we are deprived on the sole basis of prejudice
there are those who say that mutual recognition and respect for civil laws and civil rights acquired in another country and recognised and enforced in another member state would undermine a member state's competence on marriage
that is absolute nonsense
i am afraid it is an argument proposed by those who wish to have any excuse not to achieve equality
there are five member states that recognise same-sex marriage
there are twelve that recognise civil partnerships
ten of the twenty-seven remain outside that brilliant ring of tolerance equality and understanding
commissioner it is your role and i know it is a role you will take up to push them into that ring of tolerance and understanding
then we really will have an area of freedom security and justice not just for some but for all regardless of one's sexual orientation gender or gender identity
in politics it is so easy to follow public opinion
the hardest and most difficult thing to do is to lead it and to face down prejudice
if this house does the right thing and you commissioner do the right thing then we really can change the union and change people's lives for the better not only for ourselves but for generations to come
the record of your hearing is unequivocal
you said that you believed that rights acquired in one country should be respected in another
i have the quote here but i know i do not need to remind you of it because you are a woman of principle who will stand up against persecution and discrimination
