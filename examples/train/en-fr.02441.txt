mr president honourable members scientific advances over recent decades have contributed to an increase in the use of cord blood stem cells in medicines
the use of such cells has led to positive results in treating patients with blood disorders such as leukaemia
in future cord blood stem cells could possibly be used to treat other conditions in particular genetic diseases
similarly adult stem cells are also showing promising potential
however research still needs to bring proof of such potential benefits for both kinds of stem cells
the transplantation of substances of human origin including cells carries risks of disease transmission and that is why there is a european legal framework in place to ensure the quality and safety of human tissues and cells throughout the union
however let me make this very clear member states alone decide whether and how to use cord blood stem cells
the eu has no competence to harmonise the use of cells
the tissues and cells directive explicitly mentions that the eu should not interfere with national decisions concerning the use or non-use of any specific type of human cells
if however a member state decides to use cord blood cells then it must fulfil the directive's requirements on quality and safety protect public health and guarantee respect for fundamental rights
i agree with you that it is important to provide accurate and objective information to citizens about the advantages and limitations of the use of cord blood stem cells
providing such information is again the competence of the member states
the commission encourages member states to take such action and some have indeed already done so
finally i can reassure you that the commission regularly monitors the transposition and implementation of the tissues and cells directive
in fact the commission adopted a communication on the application of the directive which was sent to parliament in january twenty ten
