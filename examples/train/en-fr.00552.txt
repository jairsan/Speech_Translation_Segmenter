mr president i seek clarification
is it the case that the president has ruled that we will apply the recast procedure to the vote on the krahmer report today and the vote on the cashman report tomorrow
if that is the case my group requests that we delay the vote on the krahmer report until tomorrow so that we can investigate the implications of the application of the recast procedure to that vote
