mr president it is quite clear that the nineteen ninety-four directive served its purpose but it is now totally outdated
as has been said repeatedly the huge explosion in air travel means that we do need updated safety measures we do need more coordination we do need more inspection and we do need more cooperation
what i like about this report is that it clearly defines the role of the competent authorities
i support the proposal already alluded to by brian simpson and by the rapporteur that the european aviation safety authority should not in any circumstances have any role in safety investigation
their job and they do an excellent job is certifying aircraft but not investigating the whole situation in relation to an accident
in relation to the network of safety officers again i welcome this
training courses are crucially important because what we need to do is to reduce the current differences between the different standards applicable in the different member states
concerning the passenger list one of the major traumas in the wake of an accident is the delay in getting the passenger list
the fact that it must now be produced within one hour is extremely welcome
it is rather gruesome to have to give the name of someone when you are booking a flight but the fact that you will now hopefully be in a position to furnish the name of a person to be contacted in the event of an accident if somebody dies is very important as well because the trauma of waiting is almost unbearable
i take the point in relation to dna but if we do this if we give the name of somebody who is to be contacted then the dna can follow later
a lot of sensible proposals have been made
i commend the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs
they have done an excellent job
