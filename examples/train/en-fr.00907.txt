madam president after this joint motion for a resolution was agreed and submitted the news came of yet another disgracefully brutal case of stoning to death of a citizen in iran
therefore we thought it was appropriate to add to paragraph seven the following in this context insists that the authorities of islamic republic of iran urgently abolish the practice of stoning condemns strongly the recent execution by stoning of vali azad and expresses great concern over the pending execution of mohammad ali navid khamami and ashraf kalhori
i understand that this meets with the approval of the other groups representatives
