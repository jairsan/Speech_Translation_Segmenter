mr president i opposed the joint motion for a resolution on forest fires despite the fact that i agree with european countries cooperating voluntarily to prevent fight and repair the appalling damage caused by forest fires
however i object to the creation of european union bodies that would exercise power over member states in areas that are wider than necessary to deal with this problem
i draw attention to paragraphs three seven and eight of the joint motion for a resolution
this proposal is exploiting admirable humanitarian responses to the appalling tragedies that we have seen in order to take further steps towards the creation of the european protection force called europe aid as outlined in the barnier report
