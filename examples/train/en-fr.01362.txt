madam president today many of the challenges we face do not respect borders either political or administrative
the numbers of shared problems and challenges has grown in europe and so has the need to address them through shared efforts
that is why the european commission inspired by the european parliament and in response to the council's decision elaborated the baltic sea strategy and has now embarked on the process of preparing the danube strategy
these strategies allow the regions and countries involved to jointly respond to existing problems and to jointly exploit existing opportunities
thanks to these strategies there is a chance to have more and deeper cooperation and cohesion in the union and through this more growth and jobs improved competitiveness and better quality of life for our citizens
we in the regi committee of the european parliament expect that the danube strategy will be an action-oriented strategy based on better coordination amongst stakeholders as well as on better exploitation of synergies between policies and funds available on the ground
as the chair of the regi committee the lead ep committee for this strategy i can assure you commissioner of our support and of our openness to achieving good cooperation with the commission at all stages in the life of the danube strategy
