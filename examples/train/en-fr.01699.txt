mr president for any strategy to be effective creating strong links between its objectives and available policy tools is in my view essential and i see four main policy tools as delivery mechanisms for the eu twenty twenty strategy
firstly the most important is internal market regulation that stimulates competition and economic dynamism and recognises social obligations that result from economic integration and on that point i would like to strongly support what malcolm harbour said
secondly this is capital investment in transport energy and telecommunications infrastructures
we need capital investment on an unprecedented scale
both public and private financing must therefore be mobilised in particular public private partnerships must be strongly promoted and european financial institutions must be strengthened to overcome growth funding barriers generated by deficit and debt buyers of national budgets
thirdly this is public expenditure through the european budget
as the eu's objectives are primarily horizontal and not sectorial eu budget expenditure should be based on an integrated approach to development combined with strengthened financial and engineering instruments and promote opening of our economies to global competition
fourthly this is the coordination of national budget expenditures in priority areas through the open method of coordination
however the soft mechanisms of this method even if improved can unfortunately take us only some way towards the agreed objectives of eu twenty twenty hence it can only be a supporting tool
european coordination must be focused on areas where genuine european value added exists or can develop and where it will not undermine competition
available policy tools must be used in a way guaranteeing that the trap of a strong interventionist growth model driven by traditional sectorial industrial policy is avoided
this could undermine investment and business attractiveness of europe reducing its growth potential
eu twenty twenty must be a growth and jobs strategy because there is no other option
