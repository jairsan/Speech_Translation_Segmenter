yes you are right
firstly we have legislation
we have binding new standards and requirements applicable to offshore drilling and oil production facilities as regards equipment standards worker safety environmental sustainability emergency prevention and preparedness
in addition the member states have enacted extensive national legislation to maintain a high level of safety of offshore operations in europe
secondly we have an information response system ready to fight disasters caused by oil spills from tankers or drilling and production facilities
this system includes a set of tools managed by the european maritime agency focusing on prevention of pollution and response to pollution
thirdly there is a community civil protection mechanism that can give a response to any major crisis situation
regarding the concrete point you made on liability most european legislation on safety and the environment does not target particular industries but we can see that this legislation is applicable to all relevant economic sectors
eu legislation sets minimum safety standards which individual member states must strive to meet through their legislation
this is in line with the principle of subsidiarity
