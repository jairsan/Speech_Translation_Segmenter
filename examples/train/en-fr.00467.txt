madam president mr graefe zu baringdorf's allegation of deliberate mixing of this contaminate into feed is contemptible and unworthy of any professional politician
let us allow the due process of the legal investigation to take its course
the company concerned millstream recycling are cooperating fully
they have a full paper trail to prove they bought this oil from a licensed company in dublin that supplies oil
they bought it as a recycled light fuel oil which would have been the correct oil to use in this particular drying process
they were sold it by a licensed company and as far as they were concerned it was recycled light fuel oil they bought they accept however that they were given transformer oil which caused the dioxins
there is a legal and police investigation
let us let due process take its course and stop these allegations flying because this is a very serious issue which is not helped by hysterical and over-the-top reaction
