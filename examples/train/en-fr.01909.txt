madam president every member state in the eu faces an age of austerity
across europe radical cuts to public expenditure are being made yet taxpayers are compelled to fund the increased expenditure of the european union itself year after year
we must ask ourselves why this parliament's highest priority is not to protect the taxpayers we represent and to reduce the eu's expenditure
it is absurd that while spending on law and order and education and on other vital public services are cut at home no such discipline is shown by the eu
the salaries of many public sector workers have been frozen or even cut i wonder how much solidarity the commissioner sitting there will show them
if member states are cutting expenditure by twenty in real terms over the next five years we should demand that the eu do the same
this parliament should demand that the commission reduce its expenditure and refund the unspent money to the member states
