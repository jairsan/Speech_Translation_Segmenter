mr president i would have liked to start this debate by talking about the case of aminatou haidar
however due to the reasons we already know i cannot
in any case the question of the eligibility rights in uganda also deserves our attention and this reminds us that once again we are forced to adopt a new text condemning homophobia
in the past we have adopted several resolutions on that problem including protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies
today we need to add the new text to those already adopted
the only attempt by a ugandan mp to table the anti-homosexuality bill deserves a political response
this proposed law includes provisions to punish those alleged to be lesbian gay or bisexual with life imprisonment and even the death penalty
the draft also includes a provision that could lead to the imprisonment for up to three years of anyone including heterosexual people who fail to report within twenty-four hours the identities of everyone they know who is lesbian gay bisexual or transgender or who supports human rights for people who are
that means that any of us would also be susceptible to be taken to court for these reasons as well
we have to remind the european union and the international organisation that sexual orientation is a matter falling within the remit of the individual right to privacy guaranteed by international human rights law according to which equality and non-discrimination should be promoted whilst freedom of expression should be guaranteed
we ask international donors both governmental and non-governmental to cease their activities in certain fields should the bill pass
i strongly reject any move to introduce the use of the death penalty
if those requests are not met by the ugandan authorities then we should call on the council and commission to reconsider their engagement with uganda should the bill pass into law and breaches of international human rights law take place
for that reason i wish to remind the ugandan government of its obligations under international law and under the cotonou agreement which call for universal rights to be respected
