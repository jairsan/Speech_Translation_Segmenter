madam president as the fictional lady bracknell might have said to make one major mistake in the muslim world is unfortunate but to make two sounds like carelessness
to make three or more is an indication of stupidity insanity or deliberate mischief-making
yemen is now being called the new afghanistan
us troops are already being deployed there as advisers
how long before they and their allies including britain are deploying ground troops there against al-qaeda
what should the west in fact be doing to prevent the threat
first of all it should stop wars in muslim countries that are killing western troops killing civilians and radicalising young muslims at home and abroad
it should bring the troops home to work on homeland security to protect our populations and infrastructures
it should adopt a genuinely neutral policy towards the middle east and abandon the partisan policy of the us and it should stop immigration from muslim countries and encourage radical muslims in the west to see that they would be much happier living among their own coreligionists
