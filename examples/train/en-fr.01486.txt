mr president i would like to take this opportunity to condemn in this house the fake use of irish british french and german passports in the recent killing of the hamas commander
the chief of the dubai police said he was ninety-nine certain that mossad was behind the killing
if that is the case this was a flagrant abuse of eu passports to commit a crime in a third country and particularly a breach of trust where ireland is concerned because ever since we got our independence in nineteen twenty-two we have been a neutral and friendly country thus allowing our citizens to travel maybe more freely in places where other people would not be allowed to travel
the use of the fake passports in this situation has jeopardised that position especially in dubai
i would call on the high representative in particular to investigate this matter and if the government or mossad were behind it redress should be given to us and to the other countries involved
