mr president i represent a party that is opposed to the whole eu project and to our country's membership of the eu
this might lead people to suspect that we would object to the discharge of accounts regardless of the evidence
i would like to reject that suspicion
whilst our default position would be to object to the approval of almost all future expenditure i had hoped that we would support the discharge of accounts for past expenditure if the evidence justified it even if we disapproved of the purposes of that expenditure
however we shall oppose the discharge of the accounts as a whole because of the quantity of irregularities
we would not confuse judgment of the regularity or irregularity of expenditure with approval or disapproval of the purpose
i hope that all others whether they approve of the purposes of the expenditure or not will take the same approach
