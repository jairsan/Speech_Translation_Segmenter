mr president first of all i would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and all the colleagues who contributed to the elaboration of this important report which outlines the need for an eu strategy towards the south caucasus region
the south caucasus is not only a region in the immediate neighbourhood of the union romania and bulgaria have a sea border with it but also a region of great strategic importance for the union in political economic and security aspects
therefore the european union's main objective there should be to participate actively in its stabilisation and to encourage the development of armenia azerbaijan and georgia towards stability and democracy to establish good neighbourly relations and integration in eu policies
the european parliament supports strongly all the initiatives which increase the eu presence in the region and in particular the most recent one the eastern partnership
it offers a valuable framework for increased regional cooperation introduction of visa-free travel to the union and conclusion of comprehensive free trade agreements
this is a two-way process that requires efforts and dedication from both sides it is in the vital interests of the three countries to continue their efforts towards further democratisation
good governance political pluralism rule of law and respect for human rights are of paramount importance for determining their future relations with the union
therefore the european union should continue providing financial and technical assistance to them in order to promote these principles within the framework of political conditionality
the region's strategic geopolitical location its increasing importance as an energy transport and communication corridor connecting the caspian sea and central asia with europe and the growing eu preoccupation with energy security suggest a more active participation in the energy projects of the region including the completion of the nabucco pipeline project
however these ambitious eu policies can hardly be achieved when there is a big shadow over the region the unresolved conflicts in georgia and nagorno-karabakh
they are also a serious impediment to democratisation political stability and social and economic development
unfortunately it was owing to the two thousand and eight war in georgia that the union realised that it needs to play a more active role in the region as far as conflict prevention and conflict management are concerned
the deadlock situation due to these conflicts and the entry into force of the lisbon treaty justify an increasing pro-active eu policy
this is particularly valid for the nagorno-karabakh conflict where the union has been practically absent
simply stating support for the work of the minsk group at this stage is not enough if the eu takes seriously its new more active role in foreign policy
the union is the international mediator that is accepted by both sides and whose presence does not raise controversies
there is a need for the union to lead the international efforts for rehabilitation and reconstruction in this conflict area by initiating reconciliation projects people-to-people programmes and contacts and by sending a mission into the region once a political solution is found
the conflicts in the region also demand a special effort with regard to the situation of the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons which has serious humanitarian consequences
the european union has the means and experience to contribute to the creation of a more tolerant atmosphere in the south caucasus
it should also draw from its own historical experience and show to the people of the region that they can live together in peace and prosperity and can restore the good relations and trust which historically existed
it is a main task for the union to try to convince the leaders and the people the hearts and minds of the people in the region to support the peace initiatives not the threats not the tensions
so there is a good future if we try to do it all together
