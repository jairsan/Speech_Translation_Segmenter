madam president i would like to thank mr florenz
this is a rich report with a great number of concrete proposals
a specific call is made to use the stimulus packages all over the world to promote clean energy and green technologies stressing thereby that the financial crisis and the climate crisis have the same roots unsustainable use of resources
while i support the report like caroline lucas i would have liked to see more attention paid to the most recent signs which tell us that climate change is both more rapid and serious than we thought just a couple of years ago contrary to what some colleagues here have said in particular mr helmer
by the way a recent screening of more than nine hundred climate articles in scientific journals peer review showed that not one of them questioned the main thrust of the ipcc
what i am particularly concerned about is not co emissions per se but the positive feedback mechanisms that are now happening in the planetary system like the acidification of the oceans reduced albedo and the possible leaking of methane from thawing tundra
all these factors will accelerate warming
we can control emissions but we cannot control these factors
this is the main reason why in my opinion emission reductions have to be much more ambitious in the near future than what is currently being discussed in the eu and by the un
this means by the way that the two c target has to be revisited and that greenhouse gas concentrations have to be lowered rather than continuing to increase
that is why some of us advocate very strongly the three hundred and fifty ppm target
this dimension of the problem is referred to in the report but only in passing
i would have liked it to be at the core of the report
my guess is that only a few years from now the feedbacks i mentioned will be at the centre of the debate
finally let me just endorse what guido sacconi said
in spite of its shortcomings a temporary committee has been the right way to deal with a horizontal issue like this
i hope the next parliament will build on our experience and deal with climate change and sustainability in a similar way
