madam president commissioner rehn and mr trichet have given us more information here this evening than the irish government which has misled us and lied to us for months
they have been more concerned to defend their historical legacy than to defend the future of our people's livelihoods and indeed ireland's and europe's currency
my appeal to commissioner rehn and mr trichet tonight is that they ensure that the timeframe for aid and the targets for deficits and debt are such that the social objectives of europe are taken into account as well as the need to ensure that ireland's capacity to grow its economy and create jobs is not undermined
will you confirm also that you fully understand that increasing ireland's twelve point five corporation profits tax is not a solution to ireland's crisis nor indeed europe's current crisis but could in fact create an economic and jobs wasteland in ireland
