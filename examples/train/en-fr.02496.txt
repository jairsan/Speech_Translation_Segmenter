mr president at the beginning of this debate the commissioner praised the courage of the young people who took to the streets in egypt and tunisia and created the uprising
hundreds of thousands took to the streets in teheran and other cities in iran on monday and were brutally suppressed
they were crushed
one young student was killed
others have been tortured and taken to prison where they will no doubt be executed for trying to rise up against that fascist regime
why do we never say anything to encourage them
why are we like rabbits caught in the headlights when it comes to dealing with the mullahs in teheran
why do we say nothing to condemn the brutal psychological torture and siege of the three four hundred opposition iranians in camp ashraf
it is time we took action and showed that we support the iranian opposition
