i would like to thank the commissioner for his replies and to ask him whether if there were three counterfeiters a operating in germany b operating in ireland and c operating in slovakia each of them would get the same sentence if they were caught counterfeiting
let me put it another way is there an incentive if you are a counterfeiter to ply your trade in one state rather than another because the sentences there are less severe
in the united states to counterfeit the currency is a serious crime
do we take the same attitude in the european union
