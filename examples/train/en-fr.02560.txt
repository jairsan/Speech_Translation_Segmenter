mr president high representative iran to me represents the most serious threat to global security
president ahmadinejad is determined to arm his country with nuclear weapons and the prospect of a nuclear-armed iran is too terrifying to contemplate posing an existential threat to israel
this is why we must consider all options including military ones to prevent it
iran has deceived and obstructed the international community time and time again
sadly the european union has at times allowed itself to be manipulated by ahmadinejad
while the council regularly denounces the barbaric theocratic regime in tehran individual member states have sometimes taken a less robust approach
indeed it is only a few months ago that eu leaders agreed to proscribe export credit guarantees to iran
until then these guarantees represented a vital lifeline of an economic nature to the regime which craves any vestige of legitimacy not least because of ahmadinejad's contempt for human rights as evidenced by the regular execution of homosexuals political dissenters and minors
