mr president tomorrow tens of thousands of public sector workers in ireland take national strike action
low paid civil servants nurses teachers and local authority workers are sick of being scapegoated for a crisis in irish and world capitalism and being forced to pay for that crisis for which they are not responsible
i want from this european parliament to send the warmest support to those workers on strike tomorrow
this irish government has no democratic mandate for its savage programme of cuts
i urge workers in ireland to extend the action to bring down this undemocratic government and force a general election and let the people decide
the eu council and commission are also culpable in demanding savage cuts in ireland
these institutions have even less credibility this week after another cynical deal between the epp and the social democrats for the presidency and for appointing as high representative for foreign affairs a lady who was never elected to a public assembly but derived the new position by being placed in a chamber of feudal fossils as a result of being a labour party british trustee
clearly workers all over europe have to stand up and fight themselves rather than depend on this neo-liberal majority in this chamber
