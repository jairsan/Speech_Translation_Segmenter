mr president president obama said america has no better partner than europe
i believe that i speak on behalf of many of us when saying that this notion is mutual
the election of president obama started a new chapter in transatlantic relations that has suffered serious setbacks
as vice-chair of the delegation for relations with canada i even had to witness at one point a situation where canada acted as a mediator between the european union and the united states
my second point i welcome president obama's commitment to diplomacy with the islamic republic of iran
however as a supporter of the friends of a free iran i hope that the democratic opposition of iran will also be involved
the negotiations with iran must be transparent in all aspects
this new era in eu-us relations will hopefully extend also to us relations with third countries
europe's high expectations of president obama must now be backed by action
