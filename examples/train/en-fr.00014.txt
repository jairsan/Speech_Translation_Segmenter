firstly i would like to congratulate the commissioner on the roaming package
i think it will be positive news for many eu phone users
my particular question referred to inadvertent roaming charges when people are travelling close to a border and indeed i have plenty of experience of that myself
i heard what you said about the transparency initiative namely that when crossing borders users would be informed as to what the cost would be
that was not in reference to telephone calls but i just want to ask if you have any initiatives in that area and if you have not would you consider the transparency initiative that you mentioned a few moments ago in your reply
