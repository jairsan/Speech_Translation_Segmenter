mr president democratisation assists the peaceful pursuit of politics political change and the management of power in society as well as respect for human rights
supporting democracy underpins our foreign policy goals of preventing conflict and reducing poverty
that is why i was pleased to put the parliamentary amendment calling for european consensus on democratisation and i would like to congratulate the swedish presidency for its initiative in this respect
i strongly believe that democratisation should inform all of the european union's policies vis-à-vis third countries
i have to say that i condemn the european conservative and reform group when they oppose paragraph ten in our text and seem to suggest that europe can say one thing about democracy and do another about undemocratic countries when it suits us
no
finally as mrs malmström has said democracy building is much more than about elections it is about building pluralist civil society
that is why europe should fund ngos that increase citizen participation support the inclusion of marginalised groups provide training for legal professionals promote freedom of expression and of association and strengthen political parties in parliament
it means supporting a civilian surge
