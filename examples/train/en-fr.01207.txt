madam president during the world summit on food security secretary-general ban ki-moon said the food crisis of today is a wake-up call for tomorrow
by twenty fifty our planet may be home to nine point one billion people over two billion more than today a staggering figure and one which will mean that farmers will have to grow seventy more food
farmers in northern ireland want to help to meet that need
however most of them believe that europe is hindering their ability to produce more food by forcing a reduction in stocking rates through nitrate and phosphate regulations red tape a lack of research and development within the industry and hence an attitude that food security is not an issue
cap reform will determine the farmers ability to produce food
it will also influence the price of food
if farmers are not supported by europe through direct payments the price of food will have to increase to meet production costs
my aim is to promote food production within northern ireland and food security within europe
this will only be achieved by allowing farmers to farm
cap reform will play a huge part in this and food security should be a central component of our work as this cap reform goes ahead
