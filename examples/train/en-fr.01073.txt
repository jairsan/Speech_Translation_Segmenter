madam president the transatlantic relations that are crucial for both the eu and the us have been seriously tested in recent years
now with a new administration in the white house which is redefining us priorities and france back into the nato military structure the perspective is better
personally i consider that the time is now ripe for a substantive evaluation of transatlantic relations to give them the solid basis they deserve to withstand the current common challenges posed by the international environment energy climate change emerging new powers the financial and economic crisis and terrorism
this time we should go beyond superficial policy differences and evaluate our deeper common interests which until now have simply been taken for granted
the truth is that without such a profound joint evaluation we in the west could lose the initiative to other centres of power who will not hesitate to shape the world according to their interests not ours
security in europe for instance is one such common interest and therefore stands at the heart of transatlantic relations
even if for now war on the continent is not a serious proposition the culmination of some current negative trends could bring back that possibility if we fail to respond properly
progress is not irreversible as we all know so well in central europe
that is why before considering a proposal to re-evaluate the current security architecture of the continent we should try to have definite answers as to the continuation of us involvement the future of nato and the role expected of the eu after the lisbon treaty comes into force
if europe wants to realise its ambition to be a true player in world politics it should eliminate such differences between its members thus trying to motivate them equally around true common economic interests
