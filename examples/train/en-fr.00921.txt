mr president this is just to put the record straight as my name was cited by my colleague mr tannock
i did not call for eu observers last week and indeed earlier in the debate i was very clear in saying that should the circumstances have justified it the european union would have been able to send an observer mission to the iranian elections
however it was precisely because the commission did not have the confidence to do this that causes us proper justified and objective concerns about the conduct of those elections
i am sorry that mr tannock was not in the chamber to hear that earlier in the debate and i hope that i have been able to put the record straight
