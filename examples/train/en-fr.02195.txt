madam president one of the totems of a sovereign state is that it controls who can and who cannot come into its own country
unfortunately several governments in the uk have given away this power to unelected faceless bureaucrats in brussels
what a disaster it has proven to be
we have a situation now where we have uncontrolled eu immigration into our country which has resulted in wages being driven down and people indigenous people being put out of work
i do not believe that this eu immigration liaison officers network has any power to stop this happening at all
we also have a two-tier immigration system in our country whereby if you are from australia or new zealand or anywhere else you have a cap
however if you are from latvia or poland or any of the eu countries you can come to our country willy-nilly
this is fundamentally wrong
it is argued that this network will help control illegal immigration but what happens if a country like romania for example basically gives citizenship to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants
what it does is it makes a mockery of the whole system
i support elected politicians in the uk having control over our own borders
what i do not support are unaccountable unelected appointees
i believe that the strengthening of this network would not be necessary if each individual member state had the power to control who does and who does not come onto its lands
i therefore implore everybody to reject this report
