mr president can i say that it is rather appropriate that as we debate this very important report and i thank the rapporteur for it thirty irish farmers are staging a sit-in protest in the offices of the european commission in dublin and they intend to stay overnight
this is a really serious matter
this report reflects the frustration of members of the committee on agriculture and our farmers and consumers about the incoherence between europe's agriculture and food policy and trade policy
that is why the words in this report are strong
some people find them too strong but i think they reflect that sense of frustration
and from an irish beef farming perspective you will decimate our livestock sector a low income sector
you will destroy our environment
also may i add a few words about climate change consistency
the carbon footprint of brazilian beef is four times that of irish beef so please read this report
i call urgently for it to be supported
