madam president once again we see the european union inhabiting a virtual world a world that exists only in parliament resolutions in commission communiqu√©s and in council press releases
we condemn global warming yet our monthly peregrination between brussels and strasbourg generates hundreds of thousands of tons of greenhouse gases
we cant about sustainable land use yet the common agricultural policy encourages the felling of hedgerows the use of chemical-based fertilisers and the dumping of surpluses on vulnerable third world markets
we preach conservation yet the common fisheries policy has created an ecological calamity wiping out what ought to have been a great renewable resource
colleagues do you not think our voters have noticed
do you imagine that like descartes's malicious demon you can manipulate their reality by controlling their perception
the fact is that our voters saw through us long ago which is why at every opportunity they vote no
if you think i am wrong prove me wrong
put the lisbon treaty to a referendum
