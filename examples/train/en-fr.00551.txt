mr president those were interesting remarks but i am afraid they have very little to do with the contents of my report
i would point out that we have nothing to fear from public scrutiny and we have absolutely everything to fear as institutions from hiding information
we become more vulnerable
commissioner it is official documents which are accessible
go back and look at the report
the space to think
official documents
within the notion of a space to think that will not be official
go back to the report
accept our principles
it has been an interesting debate but i have to say that the recast which you defend is not in the spirit of the interinstitutional agreement and it is not enough
you say it has worked well but i am afraid the recast ignores vital jurisprudence on what actually needs to be done
my reasons for delaying the final vote are so that we have absolutely maximum flexibility to negotiate with the political parties and with the institutions
i would further point out that there is nothing to prevent the commission from amending its proposal at any time after the vote tomorrow except perhaps institutional and political reluctance
i find it somewhat patronising to be told that we will get action plans
commissioner i do not doubt your personal commitment to openness and transparency but i do not want action plans for our citizens
i want rights enshrined in law which cannot be taken away not gifts but rights
parliament must therefore put political pressure on the presidency to negotiate and it may be that we will have to negotiate without the commission
yes commissioner i know the council is not here but i do not give up on one council
i have been in politics long enough to know that you fight and you fight
let me finally quote this president if you will allow me my administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in government
we will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency public participation and collaboration
openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in government
so said barack obama on twenty-one january two thousand and nine
i await a comparable announcement from the commission or indeed from president barroso
