i am aware of that report of the european climate foundation and indeed under the twenty twenty strategy we have proposed a resource-efficient europe flagship initiative whose aim is precisely to decouple growth from resources giving europe a competitive advantage compared to other international partners
this objective was also fully translated in the commission's working programme for twenty ten and beyond
it is the commission's intention to develop a path for europe's transition to a low-carbon resource-efficient and climate-change resilient economy by twenty fifty particularly through the decarbonisation of the energy and transport sectors thus providing a long-term framework for policy and investment
i underline the word investment
we believe that the climate agenda can also be as the renewable energy sector is showing a way of creating more jobs in europe what we usually call green jobs
