mr president water is indeed a sensitive and potentially inflammatory issue in the middle east
high-level delegations from israel and the palestinian authority are currently discussing water rights as part of the comprehensive framework for peace
as a member of the quartet the eu supports a two-state solution as the ultimate guarantor of peace and stability in the region
therefore we must be very careful not to prejudice the delicate negotiations currently under way in washington
blaming the israeli settlers as mrs de keyser seems to be doing in particular for jordan river water overuse sends precisely the wrong signal to the people of israel our democratic ally about the eu's professed position as an honest broker
conserving the watershed of the jordan river is an important regional issue that is not of course confined solely to israel and the palestinians yet israel's opponents in this house and elsewhere are blatantly seeking to exploit this issue as part of their campaign to undermine the jewish state
in succumbing again to this anti-israeli agenda we are in danger of having the eu seen by israelis as unworthy of its privileged role as a partner for peace
