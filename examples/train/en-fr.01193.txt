madam president the countries proposed for eu membership are comparatively poor
their european dream to quote the commissioner is that they will receive subsidies
that is what it is about
the fact is that rich countries for example norway and switzerland simply do not want to join the eu
to make the telling point iceland when it was a rich country had no interest in joining the european union
now that it is bankrupt and sadly so the icelandic government is of course in the queue to join
the san andreas fault for the european union is between the seven member states who are large net contributors and the rest
this situation is unstable untenable and unsustainable
you think you are enlarging the eu empire by this ill thought-out policy
in fact you are driving it towards economic chaos in the future
