mr president the directive on defence procurement is an important step towards both the edem and the esdp
i recognise the difficulties of reconciling free market principles with inevitable discretion on defence deals and common rules covering the award of public contracts with individual practices regarding defence contracts
this very complex set of regulations has of course to pass the test of practice because trying to fit in the same box adverse elements like transparency and secrecy and commonality and individuality will require constant monitoring and the determination to penalise any individual attempt to favour one over the other in a continuous effort to keep a fine balance between all four
proper functioning will then be both a function and a reflection of the determination of the eu bodies to referee this nascent european market and of the true willingness of national defence champions and the member states behind them to respect and play the game according to these new rules
one word on offsetting
for countries like mine romania offset is at least for the time being an important mechanism to ensure the survival of our national industry
