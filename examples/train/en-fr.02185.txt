madam president culture and cultural expressions underpin people's values and identity
in the words of aristotle it is not about outward appearance but about inward significance
culture when used as a tool to impose values and to wash out diversity and freedom of expression is like a weapon
it is therefore a very troubling development that mandarin chinese has been introduced as the main language of education and official documents for tibetans
if china intends to wash out the tibetan culture this way it is acting against its own stated intentions of harmonious relations among the countless cultures ethnicities and identities the country knows
the chinese authorities should also allow access to tibet by foreign media without the need for special permits and allow uncensored communications and access to information also on the internet throughout the entire country
not only economic development but also cultural diversity and respect for human rights contribute equally to wealth
the eu should consistently prioritise human rights especially for ethnic and cultural minorities in its relations with china
