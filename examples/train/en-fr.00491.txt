mr president on twelve february two thousand and nine the dutch mp geert wilders was refused entry to the united kingdom by order of the home secretary
never before has a democratically elected politician representing a democratic party from a democratic european country been denied entry
it seems odd that the british government can find the legal means to ban mr wilders but is powerless to prevent the entry of assorted terrorists political and religious extremists gangsters criminals rapists and paedophiles from the european union and indeed the wider world
perhaps mr wilders banning had something to do with the alleged threat by a british peer lord ahmed that were mr wilders to appear in the house of lords ten zero islamist demonstrators would appear outside
this was an act of appeasement to a dark age ideology and it seems that we do not quite have the free movement of ideas across european union borders
