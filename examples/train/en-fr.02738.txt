madam president we have voted today on the two thousand and nine accounts at a time when governments across europe are having to take austerity measures expenditure is being cut and taxes are being increased
yet in the european union every year the commission demands more money and every year the court of auditors replies that the money is not being well spent
the court of auditors says that the two thousand and nine accounts on which we have just voted are materially affected by error and that is why i am very pleased that the british conservatives and our good friends in the european conservatives have voted against discharge of these accounts
the eu should take much better care of taxpayers money
