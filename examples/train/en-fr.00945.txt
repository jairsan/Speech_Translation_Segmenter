madam president as the mep that represents luton in the east of england i would like to join my british colleague arlene mccarthy in expressing our real desire to mr Å¡pidla and to the commission that they scrutinise this gm opel deal line by line to make sure that a deal which is about a european sell-off is a good deal for europe as a whole
i would also like to appeal to him to look in particular at the issues around van production which is the production within luton
firstly because magna's partner is a russian truck company and there are fears that that company will benefit at the expense of the existing production
secondly because it is expected that there must be a new model in that van market by twenty twelve and unless magna give assurances that that new model will be brought on it does bring concerns about the future of the plant
and finally there are concerns that the deal will not be compatible with the joint production venture between general motors and renault which is half of the production at luton
i ask him to do everything possible to secure that production and the jobs that are associated with it at the same time
