mr president the european union prefers to import yet more migrant labour rather than try to deal with the problem of those europeans already unemployed in member states
successful applicants for the so-called blue card work permit who are allowed to enter one member state will be permitted after eighteen months to move to another member state
this includes their family and dependants
this is part of the european union's emergent common immigration policy in which it will dictate who can and cannot migrate to member states and on what terms
britain claims to have an opt-out from this policy but the queen has given royal assent to the lisbon treaty and we face the prospect of its full ratification by the other member states
if and when the lisbon treaty is fully ratified britain's opt-out will prove to be worthless and it is almost certain that we will be forced to comply with this directive
