mr president i would like to ask the high representative in the light of all of the events that are going on in libya at the moment and the much vaunted anguish that we rightly display about the violation of human rights in libya whether she will support the cause of those people in the united kingdom who had relatives friends and loved ones blown up by semtex or killed by guns that were supplied by colonel gaddafi and his murderous regime in libya
will she support their case in any new regime that would emerge from the conflict in libya
