every single european country is united in that we all face rising unemployment which is obviously not just a social crisis but also puts extra burdens on member states public purses with rising welfare costs falling taxes and increased training
given this would you agree mr barroso that we as members of this parliament and the commission should be extra cautious with every penny that we add onto public sector burdens
if you do agree firstly how would you advise us to vote in the budget debate on thursday
secondly why do we keep meeting in strasbourg
