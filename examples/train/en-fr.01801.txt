of course the college was permanently informed by the commissioner responsible about the negotiation process
just today commissioner malmstr√∂m informed us about the final outcome of those negotiations
more than that she told us that she has maintained a very intensive dialogue with many of you in the european parliament
we are well aware of the concerns expressed by this parliament and she told me that she has kept parliament regularly informed in terms of the negotiation process
the commission has fulfilled its role in negotiating it is now up to parliament to accept or not to accept the deal
i strongly recommend you do because it is important for the security of european citizens as well
we believe that we have achieved the necessary level of protection in terms of fundamental rights and data protection but of course this is a very sensitive matter
we believe that the rights of this parliament have been fully taken on board but we had to negotiate on behalf of the european union and as i told you today's decision of the commission was taken unanimously
