madam president in the wake of copenhagen some of us are feeling like the remnants of a defeated army scattered and demoralised so i am glad you have raised the standard here and launched a fightback
but although you sound upbeat and positive in practice a lot of this is based on a wish and a prayer
we are very much dependent upon others to be able to make progress
i notice that you have talked about revisiting the idea of raising our own target to a thirty reduction
am i right in saying that you have suggested a new and more subjective formula for applying that
if the conditions are right the document says
that is new i think
why is there nothing in the document that analyses the reasons for failure at copenhagen and suggests lessons
why is there nothing here that points at the problem of climate-change denial which is sapping political will
and finally why is there nothing here about the need to bring in more business
there are lots of businesses in europe that want to work with us on this and frankly while i wish you well and while we wish you well you need all the friends that you can get
