mr president if you really want to know what somebody is up to you must listen to him telling you what he is intending to do
the european union's description of its neighbourhood policy sounds like an old man of questionable character armed with a bag of sweets explaining how innocent his motives are
the european neighbourhood policy is about membership of the european union it says
however we do have some sweets in the form of action plans on economic and social cooperation and development which contribute to sustainable growth in partner countries
it must be emphasised that the european union's motives are beyond reproach as innocent as those of the old man of questionable character
it does want to take possession of neighbouring states for improper purposes it just wants to talk about shared values
there is a name for this in english law it is called grooming
i have some advice for neighbouring countries do not talk to strangers bearing sweets
keep the virtue of your sovereignty and avoid being suborned into betraying your country even by people with the purest of motives
