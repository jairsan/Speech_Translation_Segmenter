mr president we have come a long way from the time when we were trying to keep schoolchildren out of orchards as they stole apples to the position today where they have no interest in either apples or orchards
so this fruit scheme is welcome
the problem is that many parents are not aware of the importance of fruit and vegetables so it will educate children and parents about the health benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption
of course the key to the success of the scheme will be back in the member states
we do not want a complicated rule-based scheme
we want flexibility and we need to engage with teachers in particular who will deliver the fruit and vegetables and with parents so that they will ensure that children eat and enjoy fruit and veg and develop healthy eating habits throughout their life
