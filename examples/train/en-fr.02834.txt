madam president the negotiations for the eu-canada trade agreement have been driven by major european and canadian multinationals who want market access to vital public services so that they can profit at the expense of workers and consumers
this agreement would be a charter for privatisation particularly in terms of water telecommunications and electricity
the investment chapter would outrageously give corporations the right to sue governments when social or environmental policies cut across their profiteering
canada's tar sands have become a playground for big oil companies like bp total and shell
these oil deposits produce more than three times the carbon emissions of conventional oil and their exploitation is also extremely damaging to the local environment and a threat to the first nations communities who live in the region
this trade agreement i understand could potentially cut across moves to stop this oil being imported into europe
there is an urgent need now for united action by the european and canadian trade union movement with environmental and indigenous activists to fight together and resist this proposed agreement
