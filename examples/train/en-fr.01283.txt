madam president i had the pleasure a few weeks ago of meeting some of the uk returning forces from afghanistan and i heard the same story over and over again that they were ill-equipped
yet the uk pays gbp forty-five million a day into this corrupt institution
some of that money could be better spent in arming our forces in afghanistan forces that actually train the afghan police force etc
it is quite right as some of you have said this is an important area in the world and an important area that we may need to make progress in
my problem is with the lack of experience of our high representative for foreign affairs cathy pass-the-bucket ashton with more than a few roubles in it no doubt
we need someone more experienced
she has not had any foreign office experience she has not been a foreign secretary and i do not think she even had a part-time job in a travel agents
come on this is a delicate job a job that needs to change things for the better and she is simply not experienced enough
