mr president i accept your ruling it is your right to make such a ruling but because earlier ms liotard said that we would need to have a dual base because otherwise if it was only the internal market that meant we would only be voting on economic issues without trying to open up the debate again
i would just correct her to say the single legal base that we currently have is not just economic it is about freedom of choice for patients rights
therefore our group will be voting against a dual legal base both for these original amendments and indeed the recital
i would encourage other colleagues to put the patients first
