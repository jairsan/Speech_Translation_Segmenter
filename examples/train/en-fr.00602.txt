mr president i fully endorse paragraph one e of this report which talks about the need for a partnership tackling the major issues of climate change energy security and the fight against poverty and exclusion
i have some concerns regarding the wto agreements or potential agreements from the perspective of eu farmers and food producers
as you know there was a major battle about food production standards and the commission finally conceded that it could not allow brazilian beef into the european union until it met our production standards
i applaud that decision and i think that we need to do this for every commodity
we cannot expect our producers to meet standards that third countries are not meeting
we will not get the cooperation of our producers for a wto agreement if that continues to happen
