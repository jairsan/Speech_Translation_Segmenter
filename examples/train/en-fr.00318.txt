madam president i would like to thank colleagues for their endorsement of this report and marian harkin for her words of support
it presents a clear statement of the view of this house on agriculture policy not just at the european level but also at a global level
in particular and this is important it calls for a refocus on agriculture policy in the developing world providing assistance to those who can produce food to do so locally
i believe the eur one billion that the european union will provide for this purpose is a step in the right direction
obviously i supported my own report
i believe it is a blueprint for the future in terms of how this house views agriculture
while the food security debate has gone off the political agenda the problem of thirty zero children dying of hunger and starvation every day remains with us
