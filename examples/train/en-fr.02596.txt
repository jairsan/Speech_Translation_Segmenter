mr president this memorandum requires an eur one per hour reduction in the minimum wage in ireland and a review as we have heard of the system of collective pay agreements which protect the low paid
i do not believe that this interference can be justified
the treaty requires the commission to promote social dialogue not undermine it
article one hundred and fifty-two requires respect for the autonomy of social partners not this type of interference and article one hundred and fifty-three expressly excludes eu action in the field of play
the commission cannot pick and choose the hierarchy of articles in this respect
the memorandum goes on to insist on cuts in social welfare the roll-back of key public services and reductions in public sector employment and public sector pensions
how can those demands be justified in relation to a treaty that requires the union to aim to eliminate inequalities promote a high level of employment guarantee adequate social protection and fight against social exclusion
the only honest answer to that is that these things cannot be reconciled and the problem is that these things have now as a result of the annual growth survey become the general rule
the people will reject the idea of a europe based only on austerity
they will not tolerate the far-reaching implications for social policies with lower wages lower employment protection weak social standards reduced public services and the imposition of higher retirement ages
if we want to continue to swell the ranks of anti-europeanism then carry on commission
if not please stop this nonsense now
