mr president in the thirty years since mugabe took power zimbabwe has changed from the breadbasket to the begging bowl of southern africa
the past decade in zimbabwe has been characterised by the systematic and deliberate impoverishment of most of zimbabwe's twelve million people
however some of mugabe's cronies particularly the military chiefs have become exceedingly rich through control of expropriated farmland and mineral resources
farai maguwu has bravely sought to expose extrajudicial killings and human rights abuses by the army which controls many of zimbabwe's diamond mines
inevitably the wealth from these mines is now bankrolling mugabe's henchmen
zimbabwe should therefore be refused readmission to the kimberley process
the eu should also seek to tighten and extend targeted sanctions against those in zimbabwe who have enriched themselves by trading in the so-called blood diamonds
of course farai maguwu who was exercising his fundamental right to free speech should be released from detention immediately
