mr president i live on a lovely island a beautiful island which has been systematically destroyed by the european union over the last fifteen years
i have seen the european union landfill directive which has had industrial waste laughingly called compost thrown upon the land
i have seen hundreds of thousands of fish dumped in the north sea
near my own village i have seen what used to be wonderful fields of wheat and barley and dairy cattle being turned over to things like miscanthus and all sorts of other biofuels wrecking our environment and pushing up the cost of food
the european union wants us to meet our objectives of renewable energy
thirty-five thousand wind turbines the size of jumbo jets the biggest desecration of my beautiful island since the industrial revolution
and now you are looking for a remit over one of the last wildernesses in the world the arctic
well mr president colleagues let me tell you that i agree with mrs wallis
your record is appalling and the answer has got to be for goodness <unk> keep your nose out of this
