the commission agrees with the opinion of the honourable member that clear regulatory policy is needed for investors in first-generation biofuels in order to get to the second-generation biofuels
the commission sees the first-generation biofuels as a bridge to the second-generation biofuels using lignocellulosic materials as a feedstock
without a good domestic production base for first-generation biofuels innovative and efficient products will have difficulties finding their way into the market
having said this clear regulatory policy is paramount not only to spur growth in the biofuel industry but also to avoid negative effects on the environment
the development of biofuels should also not be to the detriment of food security and also should not influence the prices of food
at the same time there should be no doubt that the commission wants to accelerate the development of second-generation biofuels
the proposed directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources clearly specifies that the contribution made by biofuels produced from waste residues and non-food cellulosic material shall be considered to be twice that made by other biofuels when counting towards national biofuels obligations
further to this member states will also be required to report on how they have structured their support schemes in favour of second-generation biofuels
the eu is also providing significant support to the ongoing research to develop second-generation production techniques
the activities under the eu's seventh research framework programme have an increased focus on second-generation biofuels and biomass to liquids processes in particular
research should include technically and economically based pilot studies to ensure not only an attractive economic benefit-cost ratio but also one that yields net benefits toward the community's goals of curtailing climate change and affordable food prices for all citizens of the world
so commission policy and the commission proposal were really tailored to the need to develop second-generation biofuels the need to use also if necessary those of the first generation but in a sustainable way
