mr president advertising is a crucial part of a well-functioning internal market to foster competition and give choice to consumers
i voted in favour of the report on advertising
it does not propose new legislation or regular advertising nor does it control or limit the internet
the report contributes to raising awareness on the need for responsible advertising to combat unfair commercial practices in advertising and to respect consumers personal data and privacy
i call on the business community to take their share of responsibility with self-regulation with voluntary actions to avoid misleading hidden and intrusive advertising
i especially appeal for children to be freed from advertising
stop using batman spiderman and bamse against our children
