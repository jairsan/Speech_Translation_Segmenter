mr president giving money from one's own pockets is an act of generosity
giving money out of other peoples pockets those of the taxpayer is both less generous and less honest
the additional eur one hundred and seventy-six million will not just be given to the poorest countries but also to emergent countries whose exports are already and increasingly destroying our manufacturing bases and the jobs of our taxpayers
a desire on the part of the eu to promote democracy and human rights in the third world might be admirable if it were not for the fact that european union countries can and do imprison people who have committed neither acts of violence nor theft but simply expressed heretical or dissenting opinions on political or academic subjects
european union countries can and do ban political parties openly as in belgium and germany or by the back door by civil action as in the united kingdom
if we wish to spread democracy and human rights worldwide we would do so more effectively and more cheaply by setting a good example
