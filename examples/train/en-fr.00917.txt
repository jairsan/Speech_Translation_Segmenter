mr president while we sit here debating the recent uprising in iran do we realise that over fifty of the student leaders the protestors who were arrested have been taken out and hanged by the iranian authorities that over two hundred people were killed on the streets including neda who has become an international and very potent symbol of the brutality of that fascist regime against the people of iran
and while we continue to enjoy our place as the biggest trading partner with the iranian government do we seriously think that money is more important than lives
why are we not prepared to put tougher sanctions in place
why do we not as a parliament scrap our delegation for relations with iran which in any case in the last five years became nothing more than a compliant mouthpiece of the iranian embassy in brussels and brought shame on the eu institutions
scrap it and let us start talking tough with the iranian authorities
it is the only language they understand
