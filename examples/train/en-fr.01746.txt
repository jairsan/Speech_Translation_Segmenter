i thank the commissioner for her reply
i wrote parliament's report on the european central bank last year and one of the issues i raised was the significant increase in eur five hundred notes and i think the eur two hundred notes as well but significantly eur five hundred notes
i raised the possibility that these were being used for money laundering purposes for criminal purposes
i understand now from the united kingdom that there are real concerns about this
could i invite the commissioner to take up with the european central bank the concerns i have raised to see who it is who is using such large quantities of eur five hundred notes
i have to say there has to be a reasonable suspicion of tax evasion or perhaps other criminal activity
