mr president i am no pacifist anybody in this chamber who knows me well would say that but there is much about warfare and the arms trade which we must regret
cluster munitions to me are one of the most horrible ways of waging war which should always of course only occur as a very last resort
there is much evidence to suggest that these weapons disproportionately affect civilian populations who must be protected above all in international law
cluster bombs can fall across a huge area and remain unexploded for very long periods of time posing a lethal threat to civilians who could be killed or maimed long after a conflict has ended
they are also costly to locate and remove and cannot be formally mapped in the same way that a minefield can
sometimes children have picked these things up thinking of them as toys and losing limbs or perhaps even their lives as a result
as a father of very young children myself few things could be more horrendous to think about
if we are serious about creating a european union of common values and sharing those values with the world we must take a common position to promote an eventual ban on these terrifying and terrible arms which are very blunt in their effect on the battlefield
we must also use all diplomatic means at our disposal to persuade others to do the same
we as the european parliament can rightly be proud of what we have done to try to rid the world of the scourge of anti-personnel land mines
we must approach this issue of cluster bombs with equal vigour and commitment in order to build a better more humane world and not see innocent civilians suffer in the aftermath of armed conflict
