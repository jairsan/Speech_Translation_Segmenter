mr president lawyers chase ambulances where there is an accident there is a parasite rushing in to profit from someone's misfortune
the advocates of european union are ambulance-chasers extraordinaire from the fantasy of man-made global warming to earthquakes and forest fires every crisis becomes an excuse to grab even more power
the russia-ukraine gas crisis was an artificial problem caused by neo-con interference in the politics of eastern europe
the answer is to stop baiting the bear and to leave the nations of europe free to buy the gas that russia needs to sell us
instead the crisis is used as an excuse for the eu to seize control of gas supplies and ensnare us all in a web of interdependence designed to enforce the union that voters would never approve
this is not about gas supplies
it is the creeping tyranny of a socialist superstate using deceit to grab what it cannot get democratically
when it drops the mask of reasonable necessity its new fascism will be imposed not with castor oil but with deadly cold
that is why freedom lovers will vote against this report
