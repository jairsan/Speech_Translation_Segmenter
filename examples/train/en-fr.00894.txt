mr president i would really like to explain my vote particularly the part on the e-privacy part of the harbour report
i think at a time when we are trying to get the right balance between national security and civil liberties i think many of us are fearful that more and more governments are collecting more and more personal data about us
almost every day in the british press we read stories about our big brother labour government collecting more and more personal data about individuals and even when they are proven innocent refusing to give back that data
but thanks to an ecj judgment some innocent people's data will now be returned
it is interesting that we also spoke about the fact that consumers need to be told if there is a breach of personal data on electronic communications networks
there is something missing in this in that we have not talked about what happens when information society services such as google or facebook lose personal data and i am quite pleased that in this report we call for the commission to investigate this further
