mr president the greatest danger that threatens us is protectionism german chancellor angela merkel told the financial times yesterday
in this context the commission's initiative comes at the right time a time when we need to refocus on the real economy to get out of the crisis
the single market act is an historic initiative
in my view it should be given the same status that the delors white paper was given twenty years ago
i truly hope that it will attract the highest political attention in the commission in the council and in the member states
i am grateful to the belgian presidency which yesterday took up my pledge on behalf of the epp to convene the competitiveness council at ministerial level and take up the single market act
i also congratulate the commissioner mr barnier on his vision of developing a citizen-centred market
this will require partnership and shared responsibility
you can count on us in the epp in the committee on the internal market and consumer protection for that
it will require partnership on the part of all the eu institutions
the commitment of the business community is equally important with self-regulation a key to success
the four months ahead must be used in the public debate to build political support and to develop with citizens and stakeholders the fifty proposal outline in the single market act
it is time for action
today i would very much like to impress on us all a sense of urgency
unemployed people cannot wait any longer for jobs citizens for better choice and lower costs business for better competition
as the rapporteur on a more efficient and fairer retail market i wish to stress that retail is a pillar of the single market and of improving our citizens lives
there are still national rules that impede free movement unfair commercial practices and restrictions to market access still exist there are toys that still have to be tested again when they have already been certified in another member state
in this respect i would like to thank the belgian presidency for their commitment to transposition
the light at the end of the tunnel is not protectionism it is free movement and the new single market act has the potential to equip europe to play its global role
