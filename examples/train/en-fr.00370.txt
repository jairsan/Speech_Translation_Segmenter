mr president hamas unleashed terror on israel's citizens and has provoked retaliation
it seems from this distance that some of them relish the new civilian including child martyrs and the publicity it gives their cause no matter how horrible it is for right-thinking people to take that in
i have never given succour to terrorism nor am i a critic of israel which has a right to peaceful coexistence in the region but we would have to be turnips not to feel emotional upset and moral shame at what is happening at present in gaza
the israeli response is totally disproportionate and the deaths of young children are particularly shameful
i have not to date opposed the new eu-israel agreement
i believe the advice of the dalai lama last month here in parliament that the best way to influence china on tibet is to keep good relations with them
i think that also applies to eu-israel relations but how can we get their attention to express the level of revulsion felt here at the scale of what is happening
i may add that yesterday a note on the humanitarian needs of the region was distributed to those of us who attended the joint meeting of the foreign affairs committee and the development committee
i urge the commission and the council to ensure that a totally comprehensive humanitarian aid package is ready so that we can move in there and help these suffering people at the first opportunity
