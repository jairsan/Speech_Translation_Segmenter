madam president a major campaign of people power in val di susa in north-west italy seeks to stop a high-speed train project known as tav being built
stretching from the french border to turin the very beautiful val di susa is only one to two kilometres in width but already has a major motorway another main road and a railway line
the no tav campaign has clearly shown that there is no justification for tav
only thirty-eight of current rail capacity is used
it would be massively damaging to the environment destroying or polluting aquifers and releasing dangerous concentrations of asbestos and uranium from tunnel excavations
only big business and major construction interests stand to gain
tens of thousands of people have mobilised in opposition and scandalously police violence is being used to intimidate the campaign
i call on the eu to withdraw all funding for tav and for the cancellation of tav
the no tav campaign's motto is
they will not flinch
a victory for people power in val di susa would be a victory for common sense and for the environment
