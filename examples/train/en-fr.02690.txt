mr president we might ask what we should do to alleviate the political impasse and suffering of the people in these countries but it presupposes three propositions
one that it is within our capacity to do anything two that it is the proper role to do anything and three that the present situation is not in any way attributable to our interference
british military personnel are as we speak being handed redundancy notices often while on active duty by the wretched uk government
it would be absurd to expect the remaining servicemen to be stretched to engage in further adventures
states make a solemn but usually unwritten covenant with their troops to send them into battle and risk their lives but only when the vital interests of the nation or nationals are at stake
we have no vital interests in these states
there is also every reason to believe that external forces associated with the united states and its allies have a vested interest in destabilising syria
i have no brief for the ba athist regime
