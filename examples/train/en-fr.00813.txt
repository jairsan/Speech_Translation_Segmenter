madam president i agree with all contributors that public health food safety and hygiene have to be at the top of all our agendas
i would put very high on my agenda too making maximum use of all natural resources including animal by-products
i should like to thank our rapporteur horst schnellhardt for his excellent work in accommodating all our concerns and also for the excellent outcome of his discussions with the european council
personally i regret the removal of the reference to the waste incineration directive but i do not have time to expand on that here
i had one amendment tabled asking for assurances that there should be a clear distinction made between animal by-products moved in large volumes between member states and at risk of entering the food or feed chain and specialist animal by-products for pharmaceutical and other diagnostic and research use the latter are safe-sourced high-value products which are transported between member states in very small volumes to and from registered suppliers processers and users
i should like confirmation both from the commissioner and horst schnellhardt again in his winding-up words that my concerns in this area are taken care of and that this particular use of animal by-products will continue without any disruption
