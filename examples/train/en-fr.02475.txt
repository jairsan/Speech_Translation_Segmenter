mr president we consider russia to be an important partner of the european union
therefore we expect russia to respect her international obligations and implement the constitutional rights of her own citizens
it is a fact that violations of human rights civil liberties and the rule of law have become commonplace in russia
unlawfulness and widespread corruption led to the emigration of three hundred zero citizens from russia last year alone
it is hard to envisage both foreign and domestic business investments in such a climate
the russian authorities are evidently implementing unconstitutional law and order
the situation in the north caucasus is one of the vilest examples of that
the russian constitution provides a basis for a multi-party system but it has become a one-party system with a marginalised parliament
i would like to ask the representative of the council which punitive measures and sanctions will be applied against the russian officials who are directly responsible for human rights abuses and perversion of the rule of law
the european union must be consistent in its policy towards third countries
it would discredit the european union if we turned a blind eye to some severe offences in some countries while imposing sanctions on other countries for identical offences
we cannot continue normal relations unless concrete improvements are made in russia
we have to face the truth
