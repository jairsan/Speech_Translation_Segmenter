mr president i thank the commissioner
i especially agree with him on his charter for sustainable economic activity
i think this is what we must take to the g twenty but i do not agree that we should use all our capital to focus on bankers bonuses
i think this is a distraction in many ways although it should be dealt with
neither is a wish list for solving the world's problems frankly likely to win the day
the financial services industry is on fire
we need first to make sure that we have put out that fire and that it stays out
for this we need a consistent approach
the g twenty is a leading forum but we also need permanent structures in place as well like the transatlantic economic council to deal with issues like ifrs
if systemic risk is to be truly dealt with we need to stop looking in the rear-view mirror and start focusing on the road ahead
