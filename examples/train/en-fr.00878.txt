mr president i welcome the general support we have heard this afternoon for the european asylum support office and would very much like to thank colleagues for their cooperation and the work that we have been doing on this
we hope that we can get this office up and running as soon as possible
its aim of course is to improve confidence between member states as the delivery of asylum systems improves on the basis of the practical cooperation between experts the training and everything else involved
maybe as that confidence improves we will see member states less worried about the fact that they might have to cooperate in an obligatory way to fulfil obligations
i welcome the commissioner's clarity about the different missions of the asylum support office and frontex
they are very different things with very different purposes although of course the cooperation and the delivery are important within them
one of the aspects that has been touched upon has been that of information about third countries the countries of origin of those seeking international protection
of course this is one of the things that the asylum support office will be looking at how to pull together that information from a variety of sources in a more standard format and perhaps a format where people will have greater confidence that the information is not being used politically
i think it is something of great wonder to many of us how one country will accept people from chechnya as refugees with quite a high acceptance rate whereas another country close by will not accept anybody from chechnya
many of us find this absolutely impossible to believe when the same information is out there
so confidence in the quality of information and the way in which it can then be used by member states is also an extremely important part of the enhanced cooperation we will be seeing
we look forward to seeing this coming into being
