madam president today the irish house of representatives the will vote on the eu-imf financial assistance package
these have been very difficult times for ireland with tax increases and cuts in expenditure
the last week's budget was only a mere reflection of the difficulties so many irish people are going through at the moment
this follows fourteen pay cuts in the public and private sectors
however i strongly believe that the eu-imf financial package will help ireland restore confidence by getting the banks capitalised and lending again and by repairing the public finances
i do not necessarily share in accepting the detail of the plan but overall figures are supported by
the underlying economic trends in ireland are quite good
it will require good government and d√°il oversight to ensure our finances never again get out of hand
it will also require some thought at eu and ecb level on the contribution made by low interest rates to property inflation
i was a lone voice in this chamber for two and half years questioning mr trichet on this particular difficulty
with the establishment of a permanent successor to the european financial stability mechanism from which ireland will be receiving eur twenty-two point five billion in loans if it draws them down the eu-imf package is a positive move for the eurozone
may i say also in conclusion that there are many people here who consider themselves federalists and yet want to see some sort of harmonisation in taxation
in the united states over fifty of companies in the copyright business register in delaware
why do they do that
because of the tax situation in delaware
there are some very ignorant comments made in this chamber by self-serving people who want to advance their own national causes by making inaccurate statements and they will be challenged
