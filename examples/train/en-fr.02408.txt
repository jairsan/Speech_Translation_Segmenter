mr president the current events in tunisia egypt and other countries in the region must remind us that stability without freedom is if not a mere illusion at least an unsustainable reality
we must also remember that a revolution or a social upheaval is a guarantee of change but it is not a guarantee of change for the better
i hope that we will find the inspiration to assist this process in order to make it a process which brings change for the better and not for the worse
deep analysis is needed of the situation in both tunisia and egypt and not only there since we have to understand whether we did the right things in the past with a view to avoiding these crises
what steps should we take in the future in order to anticipate or avoid similar crises
and lastly what could we do in order to make sure that the present crisis will move things towards freedom for the peoples concerned and stability for the region while avoiding any shift towards more or another type of instability and another type of totalitarianism or oppression
we need to adopt a preventive and proactive attitude in this respect and that requires strategy
certainly our messages were correct in terms of balancing the key word reform with the key words order or stability
but the devil is precisely in the detail and indeed it is the feeling of many of us that we have not yet addressed the details and that we have not shown enough vision or enough strength in addressing the challenges
another important factor is our capacity to talk to all valid actors including the islamic forces in such a way as to be able to integrate all of them into a positive process
we hope that the commission and the council will be able to shape such a strategy in the future and we would be happy if they could tell us more about that
