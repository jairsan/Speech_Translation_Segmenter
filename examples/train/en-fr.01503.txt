mr president it being international women's day i wanted to raise a particular female health issue which persistently remains a cinderella issue
i stood here two maybe three years ago talking about a silent unseen painful and debilitating female illness endometriosis an illness which destroys lives families and fertility you see some women do not even have the chance to be mothers
maybe it is because it is about women's menstruation that we do not want to talk about it do not even want to name it
so i will say it again endometriosis
it still has no known cause still no known cure and still affects up to one in every ten women and rising
this week is also endometriosis awareness week across europe
so when are we going to take those women their families and their sufferings seriously
it is good that you are here commissioner to hear this perhaps proper dedicated funding and i hope before next year
