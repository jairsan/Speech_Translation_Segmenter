madam president how often do we wonder about the side-effects of medicines we are taking
how often do we wish for more information on products and illnesses
this report deals with these questions and the need the public has for information
the change of focus from the original council proposals was important as was the emphasis on the patient's right to access information as opposed to the possibility of pharmaceutical companies providing information
this was achieved by a ban on direct consumer advertising for prescription-only medicines
in addition an important issue was the recognition of the national competent authority and healthcare professionals as the main source of information
again this was achieved
the information to patients directive sends a strong message on the rights of patients
i congratulate the rapporteur on tackling a difficult dossier and producing a comprehensive directive which i hope we will all support unitedly
