mr president it seems that nick clegg the uk deputy prime minister will soon announce the coalition government's decision to comply with the ruling of the european court of human rights and grant the vote to inmates of her majesty's prisons
a spokesman for mr david cameron the prime minister has reportedly said that it would be unfortunate if the blanket ban was lifted entirely
he did not go on to explain why a partial ban might be more acceptable morally and why a thug burglar or thief should have the vote rather than a murderer rapist or paedophile
it is an insult to the law-abiding and the victims of crime that those who break the law should also have the right to elect lawmakers
i can say one thing with absolute certainty which is that in the next manifesto of the uk independence party there will be a commitment to repeal any such law
