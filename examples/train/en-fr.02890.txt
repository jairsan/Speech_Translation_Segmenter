mr president i understand mr duff's point and as ever the theory is right but the practice is not
show me the evidence of where transferring that support makes for greater efficiencies through spending by the european union
show me the evidence of where it has actually saved citizens money rather than costing them more
i say again this budget is evidence of a call from mr duff and his colleagues for more europe not smarter europe
the united kingdom government is asking for better spending not more spending
