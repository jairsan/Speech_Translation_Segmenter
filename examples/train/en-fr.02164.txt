madam president africa is the richest continent in the world and its people the poorest in terms of per capita income
how is this possible
i think commissioner piebalgs struck the right note when he said that we need concrete action at a regional continental level
to get there we do not need more handouts which just keep people in subsistence poverty we need to work to create economic growth
economic growth can only come from enterprise and education but education and enterprise can only come if there are the instruments to create economic growth
for example much of africa does not have electricity so africa does not have the proper education or the proper computers or the proper infrastructure for economic growth
we now need to put more electricity into africa we need clean water and we need to have food security
i am delighted that the african union is now following a policy of zero tolerance for coups d Ã©tat
hooray as the council said
what we need to do now is to look at africa as a modern emerging economic tiger and enable africa to be fuelled faster and quicker in order to grow richer
