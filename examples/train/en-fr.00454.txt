mr president nissan has announced the loss of one two hundred jobs at its sunderland plant in my north-east england constituency
that is about a quarter of its workforce and to that will be added an as yet unknown number of jobs in its supply chain
nissan's sunderland plant is widely acknowledged as the most productive in europe
if the plant with the highest productivity in europe needs to lay off a quarter of its workforce then heaven help us when this crunch fully hits the less productive
a recovery task force has been set up in my area involving all major regional actors
the measures they are planning assisting job search training and retraining starting small companies assisting self-employment are all ideally suited for support from the european globalisation adjustment fund
i welcome the commission proposals to simplify that fund
it needs to be urgently simplified and mobilised on a massive scale as part of a coordinated european response to the crisis in the car industry
only a tiny fraction of that fund was used last year
let us not hoard it
let us put it to work to put our people to work
