mr president i want to thank the rapporteur for the report
rising feed prices and import bans put in place by other countries have highlighted just how exposed the eu is in relation to animal feed supplies
protein supply is most important for the livestock sector and its profitability
farmers in this sector in my constituency are in very grave difficulties at present particularly in the pig sector
despite the reservations of the rapporteur can i also say that i believe that europe must move to a solution in relation to zero tolerance
i was speaking just last week to people in my constituency at home who are actually importers of feed
they were saying that the recent moves are merely political nods which do not and will not provide a long-term solution and we really do need to move to a solution in relation to zero tolerance
