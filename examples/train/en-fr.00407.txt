madam president it is understandable in this climate that there is concern about the success of manufacturing in the face of competition and of course textiles are very important
employment has continued to drop and production has fallen again and that is after a couple of years of relative stability
of course the sector is at the cutting edge of globalisation
small and medium-sized enterprises play a huge part in this
following the end of the memorandum of understanding in two thousand and five we did have the agreement on the joint surveillance system to which mrs wortmann-kool drew our attention and it has given us early information about trade flows
we are therefore better able to react in the event of being faced with a sudden surge in our industry
it is also a further step in the transition to open markets designed and developed as i am sure members know with the economic players concerned and in discussion with member states and with parliament
by promoting a process of gradual change we have helped the sector adapt
that has been supported by the social partners
they did not ask for an extension of the voluntary growth levels under the memorandum of understanding mou when it ended in two thousand and eight nor have they been asking for a continuation of the surveillance system into two thousand and nine though i appreciate that some member states would have preferred us to do so
imports from china have increased overall but within reasonable limits
significant increases in some categories such as for example dresses trousers and pullovers have been balanced by drops in textile imports from suppliers in other countries
so overall in two thousand and eight only a slight overall increase was realised and markets have absorbed that reasonably well
the right political responses are not to close our markets or monitoring of the imports
we need to ensure that all businesses can change adapt trade and innovate out of current conditions
it is precisely to help businesses like this that the economic recovery plan was endorsed
that of course represents a huge boost of one point five of eu gdp which should help the textile and clothing sector
the challenges for the sector predate the current slowdown
eight of the fifteen applications under the globalisation adjustment fund have been to support textile workers
the commission is ready to support initiatives to set up partnerships in the textile and clothing sector designed to anticipate restructuring with the aim of protecting employment and overall the sector benefits from the fact that there is a long-standing framework for social dialogue
we welcome parliament's resolution on the future of the textile sector
we move forward in market access in funds from the lead market initiative and in every free trade agreement as causes dedicated to environmental and social standards
of course currency devaluation remains on our agenda
