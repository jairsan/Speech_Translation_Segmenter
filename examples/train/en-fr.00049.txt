mr president thank you very much for offering me this opportunity to offer my explanation of vote on the suspension of the doha round
it is with great gratitude that i recognise that most of this house is quite sad at the suspension of the wto doha round because actually there were real goals to be gained from further liberalisation
unfortunately once again it was agriculture that held us up and while the eu managed to avoid the blame i think we have to recognise that we had our own internal politics and that when commissioner mandelson wanted to go further on agriculture he was held back by some of the most protectionist states in the european union
we need to recognise that there is a greater goal out here that services that make up so much of our economy need to be unlocked and liberalised
unfortunately we have to unlock agriculture and goods before we unlock trade in services
we need further opening of trade
we need to stop protecting uncompetitive farmers
we need to make it easier for entrepreneurs and farmers in developing countries and poorer countries to trade with us sell their goods and services because only trade not the large aid industry will help these people out of poverty
