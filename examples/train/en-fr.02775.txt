mr president the small business act is precisely what we as politicians and legislators should be focusing on as we look for ways of fostering new growth and re-energising our economies
smes make up more than ninety-eight of the businesses in my rural constituency of wales
as public sector jobs in the uk as a whole are becoming less certain and more of my constituents are i hope going to be either setting up or working for small businesses i fully support and endorse the ambitious targets for reducing the administrative burden on smes and goals such as the sme test for all legislation
coupled with the one in one out policy for regulation that my own government is operating these measures should begin to achieve our objective
but now is the time to be bold to be more ambitious and to achieve more
i have seen so much creativity in wales as it develops into a hub of activity for new businesses in the highly profitable global gaming world and a centre for cultural excellence with regard to film and programme production yet i find myself asking questions about how to foster and encourage this development
big projects like the european patent and the digital agenda need to deliver for these small businesses providing jobs and a future for people in wales and the whole of the eu
