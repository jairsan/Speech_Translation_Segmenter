madam president i would just like to make a small and medium-sized intervention on my favourite subject of smes
i was delighted that commission president barroso made many remarks about smes in his opening comments
but if i have a concern it is a concern that he talks words as one has to when one talks but we have not yet seen enough action a comment that malcolm harbour made earlier on today
i notice that in section three of your legislative and work programme for two thousand and nine a very important section entitled better regulation delivery on promises and change of regulatory culture there is a comment that a simpler and better regulatory environment without unnecessary administrative burdens will therefore remain a key component of the commission's legislative work
with due respect commissioners and i speak as a great fan and supporter of the commission in this regard i have not yet seen evidence of this being in this legislative programme
there is a lot of talk of that yes we will do it we will reduce by twenty-five but where is the beef
where is the reduction
we have not yet seen it
so going back to the heading better regulation delivery on promises if there is one word that you remember for this legislative programme commissioners that word must please be delivery
my final thought is that i do recognise that changing culture takes time and also speaking as the coordinator for employment and social affairs for the ppe-de group i do realise that the committee on which i have the great good fortune to sit is not always the greatest ally in the cause of better and simplified regulation
but i have to suffer in this committee and my invitation is that one of you should come and suffer too if only briefly because we may be part of the problem
but if we could somehow create a new precedent that ideally the commission president would come and address our committee maybe that would help make our committee help your work and we could then become part of the solution
