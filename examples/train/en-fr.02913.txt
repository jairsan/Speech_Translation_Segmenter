mr president the measures we are discussing here this evening are to be welcomed
i think they show that the european union has the capacity the will and the intelligence to take measures arising out of the lessons we have learned from the economic crisis
and particularly i think that some have said that this is a transfer of powers from member states to the european union
this is the old hoary chestnut that is brought forward to object to every proposal
if you are part of the european union it has to have some powers and certainly we are sending out a message to the markets and the citizens that we can deal with crucial issues when they occur
certainly i agree completely with what we are doing and i also would love to see us adopting automatic binding sanctions and also the reverse qualified majority voting system
that would ensure that we would stay out of crisis in the future
prevention is better than cure and this is all about prevention
learning from what we have learned already
