madam president the case of manuel rosales is another example of the arrogance and paranoid behaviour sometimes exhibited by the increasingly more authoritarian government of venezuela
the political persecution of mr rosales and many others is regrettable and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms
we will call on the government of that country in earnest to start behaving sensibly and democratically and to stop violating the human rights of its citizens
madam president since this is the last time i will be making a speech in the plenary permit me to take the opportunity to thank you and all our colleagues who have faithfully attended the thursday afternoon human rights debates and have contributed towards making our world a better place to live in
let me also take the opportunity as i have so often done in the past to remind my colleagues of the plight of my own country cyprus which for the past thirty-five years has been suffering under the military occupation of its northern part by turkey
the citizens eu citizens of areas such as kyrenia famagusta karpasia and morfou have been living in exile since the devastating turkish invasion of nineteen seventy-four
we are looking towards the eu for the fulfilment of their humble wish to return to their homes and live there in peace and security
i hope the eu will not let them down
