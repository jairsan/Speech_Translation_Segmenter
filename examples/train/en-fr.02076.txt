mr president in my opinion on mr feio's report on governance and the stability framework i emphasised three points
the first was the need to be serious about sanctioning member states that breach the stability pact
just a couple of days ago the french prime minister and the german chancellor even agreed to change the treaty to bring in tougher sanctions against countries that threaten the euro's stability
i also emphasised the need to prioritise spending in the budget in case a member state has to be rescued
finally i raised awareness about the need to evaluate the impact on the credit rating of the european union since it acted as guarantor of the european financial stabilisation mechanism
the relevant paragraphs have been amended and no longer form part of my opinion
i feel obliged in these circumstances to disown my opinion
