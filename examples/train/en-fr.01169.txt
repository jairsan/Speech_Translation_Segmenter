mr president this has been a long journey from tampere where we saw just the outlines of an area of freedom security and justice and perhaps we talk too much to this extraordinary position where we have stockholm and lisbon colliding
i say respectfully to all of those who believe that we do not need a blueprint to fight our corner for the area of freedom and security and justice that we want we do not take our players off the field when the game begins
we fight our progressive corner and for our group we will fight for our progressive policies
but we must have a stockholm blueprint in the first place
we have lisbon so we all members here however they vote will have to assume our responsibility to legislate after christmas on the things that matter to us
this is a serious responsibility and my group as our hard-working rapporteurs mr l√≥pez aguilar and mr berlinguer have set out has its priorities
we will then have an area of freedom security and justice in a democracy that we win or we lose
regarding our priorities on anti-discrimination we send a message to the council
we want a horizontal directive
we must fight for this progressive line
on criminal justice we say mutual recognition is important so that the european arrest warrant will actually work
on asylum we say yes to solidarity between member states but for us a progressive solution means that those asylum seekers who are vulnerable must have the best representation
so these are our group's priorities this is our added value on the subject of hate crime on amendments on migration policies on violence against women on a european protection order
all of these issues illustrate how we as a political group how all political groups can add value to the stockholm programme and can create legislation which is meaningful
ultimately we play the game because for our citizens this is not a game
this is about delivering at last at long last the rights that they have asked for for so long fundamental rights on data protection on security and on anti-terrorism
all of these things will mean something when we assume the responsibility in this house to legislate
we will only do that when we vote through the stockholm programme
we will then fight for a progressive stockholm programme and progressive legislation
