madam president exaggerated claims have been made and fears expressed by all sides on this report
it is has been difficult to distinguish fact from fiction and to come to a decision on how to vote
while i recognise the concerns of the soft fruit industry the potato industry and the cereal farmers in ireland who have spoken to me about this i supported the compromise
i feel the improvements made were worth our support even though i still have some concerns
i supported the vote as in my opinion the worst of all outcomes would be to deliver this report to conciliation
the five-year derogation renewable if necessary for essential plant protection projects is an important safety net and also encourages the agrochemical industry to research and produce alternatives
