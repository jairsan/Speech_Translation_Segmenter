mr posselt you may be assured that we will continue to survey the situation very closely and that is also part of the commission's constant work
they will do that of course
we are aware of the improvements and the situation is fragile
but there are improvements and these institutional arrangements that i refer to that have been done are a good step in the right direction
we can only hope that with our support as well as the support from osce this development will continue in that direction
