mr president we will get over this confusion eventually
the regional aid map for state aid rules in europe is in serious need of redrawing
a major concern is that when i wrote to the previous commission on this they were basing their policy on two thousand and six figures from eurostat
now that the regional aid map is up for review it is extremely important to recognise that the european economy is in a dramatically different picture
taking just one example in my own country unemployment levels in the mid-west of the country have grown by over forty in the last year and this without mentioning the previous years where figures were rising already
areas in the mid-west like limerick clare and tipperary need large-scale state funding to stimulate primary job creation and it is getting to critical levels
given the dramatic turnaround in the irish economy as in other economies the years of two thousand and six and two thousand and seven might as well have been a lifetime ago
while i recognise that it is partly up to member states to inform the commission of any changes in their economic status the approach of the commission should not remain the same regardless
