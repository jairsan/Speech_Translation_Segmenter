mr president afghanistan's new law effectively legalising rape in marriage and also child marriage for shia women threatens to take the country back to the medieval days of taliban rule
certainly this law makes it harder to distinguish in terms of modernity and respect for women's rights between the elected afghan government and the taliban terrorists against whom it is fighting
the law also makes it hard to justify the international community's massive military and financial assistance to afghanistan
i feel very uneasy about soldiers from my country the united kingdom dying to defend a government that panders too much to extremist and obscurantist sentiments
to his credit president karzai has said this law will be repealed but it has taken a great deal of international pressure including this resolution from our parliament to get us to this stage
also the repeal of this law should not obscure the fact that women in afghanistan continue to suffer lack of schooling injustice and discrimination on a daily basis
there is still a very long way to go to bring afghanistan fully into the modern world and hold it to its binding international commitments
