mr president taxation as a concept has not really changed very much in the last three zero years has it
the rich and the powerful stealing money from ordinary people to make their own lives more comfortable
where there has been a change in modern times is that now taxation is for the benefit of the taxed that somehow we are being taxed
in order to perpetuate this myth we invent periodic scares to frighten people into submission
the latest of these scares is of course that if we do not cough up green taxes we will all boil to death reminiscent of the medieval religions is it not which played the same game pay up or burn in hell
tax harmonisation is a concept dreamed up by the modern political class to make sure that no government steals too little from its people a sort of thieves cartel if you will
may i suggest if you really want tax harmonisation that the commission and the bureaucracy pay the same taxes as the electorate that they bear the same burden of tax as the rest of us before the electorate storm this building and hang us from the rafters as they have every right to do
