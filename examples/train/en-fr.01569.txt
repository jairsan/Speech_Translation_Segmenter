i would like to congratulate the minister on his excellent answer and the fine work which we in europe are doing to protect the rights of immigrants
my fear is that sometimes we fail to protect the rights of our own citizens when they move from one country to another
i think particularly of some of my east midlands constituents who have spent their retirement savings on a home in spain only to find after living there for two or three years that they have the bulldozers at the door and their rights of property their rights to the enforcement of contract are simply ignored by the spanish courts and the spanish authorities
i should be grateful if the minister could explain to us why this is and what action spain will take to resolve this problem for european citizens in his country
