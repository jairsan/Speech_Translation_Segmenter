madam president zimbabwe is becoming a failed state
half of the population will survive under foreign sustenance or will face starvation
sanitation and unpolluted water are almost unavailable and as a result a devastating cholera epidemic is spreading within zimbabwe and the surrounding countries
all this is because mr mugabe and his cronies want to punish their own people because they voted for him to go
the south african mediation was unsuccessful and the african countries have so far been disappointing in taking resolute action
the above picture constitutes a grave humanitarian catastrophe so as a first step mr mugabe should be referred to the international criminal court to be indicted for crimes against humanity and to have an international warrant issued for his arrest
