mr president feeding the hungry is an essential duty and we have to find a way to see that no person especially a child goes to bed hungry
i abstained on this report however because i find changes in this scheme do not really make sense
to have a cap policy buying in food from third countries whose poor people are already hungry to feed our poor while other cap policies prevent our farmers from growing enough food to feed the hungry of europe simply does not make sense
we need to feed the poor especially in this economic crisis and i will be advocating changes to the scheme that will achieve this end
