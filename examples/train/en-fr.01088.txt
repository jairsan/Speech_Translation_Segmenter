mr president with the lisbon treaty about to enter into force this is an historic moment to concentrate first of all on europe's common future and common good
i am afraid that it is not the best opportunity to use these last moments to advance national interests playing on the nerves of other partners
global challenges to europe cannot be solved without efficient common institutions and common policies
however today's europe needs more than ever the far-sightedness moral commitment and perception of common european values that inspired our founding fathers to break the vicious circle of history and national egoisms
that is why we need for europe's progress and credibility in the world not necessarily good conductors of affairs but real statesmen strong democratic leaders having a vision and authority to bring about a change also in europe
therefore we need a clear commitment to and practical implementation of european common institutions
we need not only a common foreign and security policy with an external service but also a common energy policy
the european council will also approve the baltic sea strategy
i would like to thank the commission and the swedish presidency once again for taking it on board
now the task of the council is to implement it without losing time
i hope that the baltic sea strategy will get the attention it deserves also from the spanish and belgian presidencies
i support the idea of minister malmstr√∂m that the baltic sea strategy can be seen as a model pilot project for other macroregions of europe
nevertheless no eu strategy will be taken seriously without having sufficient resources for its implementation
the existing budget line needs some money and some credibility
