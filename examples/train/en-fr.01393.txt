mr president i voted against the appointment of the new eu commission because it will simply continue with the same right-wing neoliberal economic policy that has already resulted in disastrous crisis in the capitalist economies of many eu states
this allegedly new eu commission will turn out to be the same stale old wine with the same old neoliberal barroso label
these policies of liberalisation deregulation and privatisation implemented let us be clear at the behest of european big business are having disastrous consequences for the lives of working-class people with mass unemployment and savage attacks on living standards
in its attitude to the crisis in greece and in ireland the leadership of the eu commission is agreed that it is the working class who will pay the price while the bankers and speculators are baled out
european workers and the poor in europe must mobilise their power against these disastrous policies and for a genuinely democratic and socialist europe and that means opposing the policies of this new eu commission
