mr president if you will pardon the pun i think this is a catch twenty-two situation for many of us because if we ban the catching of fish and particularly of bluefin tuna fishermen will go out of existence
if we do not ban it then there will be nothing to catch
i think one of the key elements here and it is constantly coming up in many of our debates is the scientific evidence
people have said that the scientific evidence is not reliable enough it is not extensive enough and it is not up-to-date enough
i would like to ask the commission and the council are they happy with the scientific evidence that is being produced
because you can quote scientific evidence but then somebody might come along with a different example of a recommendation from other scientists
so i think that is a key element in this and i would like to hear what the commission and the council have to say about it
