madam president i want to make two points
firstly on values
the european union is a union of values
these values are criteria for accession
they guide us in our behaviour
they are a means to build interoperability with our external partners
however we should not make the scope of our external policy from exporting our values
on the contrary we have to learn to operate in a diversified world and even to respect the other's right to be wrong
secondly on institutions
the international institutions and international law of today were shaped and created in a completely different world
each day we realise that they are not adapted to the new challenges new opportunities and new threats of today's world
i believe therefore that the european union should support the idea of a new conference on security and cooperation in europe in a larger europe from vancouver to shanghai not only to vladivostok in order to create a new space of security of freedom and of cooperation
i think that this should be one of our top priorities and we should not be afraid that others perhaps have other ideas on that
