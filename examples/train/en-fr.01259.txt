mr president as a member of the parliamentary delegation to israel i listened with interest to the foreign affairs council's comments on the middle east peace process and the commission's statement
however i like my previous colleague are left with an overriding sense of concern in relation to these
israel is the only functioning democracy in the region
the favourite tactics of its opponents have been terrorism against the state
i believe that the council and the commission statements fail to give proper weight to israel's security concerns
in fact i did not hear the high representative mention those concerns in her statement to this house
furthermore i believe that the statement places too strong a burden upon israel both in terms of the failure of the process to progress and on the resolution of the outstanding issues in particular jerusalem
