mr president i did not vote in favour of any of these resolutions because as a matter of principle i do not recognise the democratic legitimacy of the european union and i never will
however it should of course be the right of sovereign nations to decide who can and cannot enter their territories and on what basis
eu states have abdicated that right by recognising the supremacy of eu law and in particular by adopting directive two thousand and four thirty-eight ec on the free movement of people
the french cannot have it both ways
they cannot be full members of the european union and then discriminate against romanian gypsies
if the french do not like it then i suggest that they adopt the policy of the uk independence party which is to leave the european union and regain their sovereignty
