mr president this brok report is positive proof of the emergence of a single european union superstate
the wicked lisbon constitution already forces an unelected president and foreign minister on us all
now this report adds a new european diplomatic service the so-called european external action service but embassies represent national interests
so what national interests will these new eu diplomats and embassies represent
they will not be those of our nation states our trade or our companies
they will be those of the european commission
all other national embassies will become redundant
already british embassies around the world are selling off properties
this master plan for an eu superstate is built on foundations of deceit dishonesty and denial but federalists are not creating a new united states of america
they are creating a new yugoslavia
by forcing very different nations cultures and economies together under a rigid undemocratic soviet-style bureaucracy you are entering very dangerous waters indeed
i worked for the british government on the northern ireland peace process
i saw what happened when democracy fails
it is not pretty
now i see democracy failing here in europe
you profess to love peace but by railroading through lisbon and by this power grab of our embassies you are putting europe firmly back on the road towards war once again
