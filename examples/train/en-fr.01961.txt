mr president competition for water can exacerbate or even ignite conflict whether it is the receding glaciers of jammu and kashmir the tensions amongst central asian countries over the depleted aral sea rival tribes vying for the same waters between sudan and somalia or indeed here in this debate about the lower jordan valley
the rehabilitation of the jordan river and the cooperation required to achieve it might just enhance the prospects of peace too
that river has been immortalised in the holy books of judaism christianity and islam with references associating it with the prophets moses and elijah and as the burial place of four companions of the prophet mohammed
the jordan river was crossed by the israelites under joshua and it is here that the miracle took place of jesus walking on the water
we should not need another miracle for its waters to be protected for the benefit of the peoples of the region today and for future generations there to live in peace and prosperity
