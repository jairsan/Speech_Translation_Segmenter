mr president when my constituents ask me about the main benefit of being part of the european union my reply is always the free trade that exists between nations and the internal market that we are seeking to complete
i therefore welcome this consumer rights directive
i welcome it because it takes an albeit small step towards completing that single market
it will give some benefits to consumers and small businesses
it will assist in internet and cross-border trade
however i have to say that this directive has taken a long time to come about and progress is modest
the plea that i would make to the commission is that we need a framework for completing the single market as opposed to the rather disconnected series of initiatives that we have at the moment
