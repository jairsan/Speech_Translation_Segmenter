madam president first i just wish to record the fact that i pressed the wrong button on the mcguinness report
in fact i completely support the mcguinness report on food security but i will check that with the services later
i particularly agree with the point that we need to adapt the cap to meet food security concerns and the fact that farmers need a stable policy environment in order to plan for the future
we cannot have certainty but we certainly need to have some stability
in addition i support the fact that the market alone cannot provide income security for producers and also the call for a detailed impact assessment in particular let us say on the implications for food security
if we look at particular eu proposals for example on plant protection again we need a proper detailed impact assessment on that and we need to take food security into consideration when we conduct that assessment
