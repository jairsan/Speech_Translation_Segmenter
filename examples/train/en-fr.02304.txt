mr president i welcome the moves for switzerland to increase its cooperation with the eu in the fields of education training and youth
the youth in action programme is a very important programme for young european citizens
it is a programme that needs to be highlighted more and its aims and objectives need to be realised in particular with regard to the european voluntary service's activities under the youth in action programme
given that next year is the european year of volunteering it is particularly significant that the european voluntary service which supports young people's participation in voluntary activity and aims to develop solidarity and promote active citizenship amongst young people is strengthened
in ireland volunteering in grassroots sports organisations offers sporting and leadership opportunities to thousands of young people
these organisations encourage active citizenship amongst young people while promoting health fitness and an active lifestyle
the programme and its voluntary measures should be enhanced and strong links should be forged with switzerland in this regard
there are many possibilities under the youth in action programme and any measures to enhance its aims and to encourage and support young people in the eu should be sustained and strongly encouraged
