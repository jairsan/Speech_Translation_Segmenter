madam president whilst we all unite in condemning flagrant human rights abuses in countries such as iran and china we must start distinguishing these from the grossly over-the-top eu-inspired human rights industry
the public are now bamboozled by this human rights fest
there is the eu fundamental charter of human rights in the treaty of lisbon there is a european court of human rights over there which seeks to give british prisoners the vote even murderers and paedophiles
there are excessive eu employment rights and american-style rights too for damages and national legislation such as the uk's disastrous human rights act which allows foreign terrorists and criminals to stay in britain because their rights are now seen to be more important than those of the decent citizens they threaten
the truth is the noble cause of human rights has too often descended into a deep trough with millionaire lawyers growing rich defending the spurious rights of terrorists criminals and the greedy
this has to stop
