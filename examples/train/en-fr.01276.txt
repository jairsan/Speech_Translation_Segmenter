madam president commissioner vassiliou has asked me to pass on her apologies for being unable to be present to speak on this oral question relating to the commission report on experience gained from application of the food hygiene regulations
on behalf of the commission i would like to underline that the report is based on information received from relevant stakeholders from both the public and private sectors and the outcome of these consultations has been positive
no major difficulties were identified but in some areas there is still room for improvement
turning to specific issues firstly i am aware of the problem of the reapproval of small capacity establishments
solutions to such problems can be found through the flexibility provisions in the regulations to be adopted at national level
where this approach has not been followed difficulties have arisen in certain member states
the food and veterinary office is currently carrying out specific missions to identify best practice of such flexibility for small capacity slaughterhouses with a view to their wider dissemination
due to the fact that member states have until the end of this year to decide whether to grant or refuse approvals i cannot say at this stage how many small and medium-sized enterprises were refused approval
secondly the flexibility provisions aim more generally to protect food diversity and help small scale producers
the adoption of national measures to apply flexibility and the notification to the commission provide legal certainty for small scale producers and acknowledges the specificities of smaller scale establishments
at the same time food diversity such as traditional production methods for sausages or cheese is ensured without compromising food safety
in order to encourage the correct use of flexibility provisions the commission has published several guidance documents
this should further contribute to ensuring transparency and legal certainty
it is also important to recall that the commission in an effort to contribute towards a reduction of administrative burdens notably for very small enterprises has already suggested amending the regulation accordingly
however this suggestion is still pending as you know
thirdly food chain information includes a written communication from the farmer to the slaughterhouse and its official veterinarian
this information provides essential data to ensure a risk based inspection
the competent authorities have recently been allowed a derogation from the provision that the information must be delivered to the slaughterhouse at least twenty-four hours in advance
additionally i am pleased to announce that next april the next commission will organise a round table with all parties concerned on a possible revision of meat inspections in order to consider its effectiveness taking into account recent trends of hazards
finally i would stress that laboratories involved in official controls must be accredited to ensure high quality and uniformity of analytical results so as not to jeopardise the safety of food
this is essential for the smooth day to day running of intra-eu trade and for facilitating trade with third countries
however the commission has recently agreed to an extension of a transitional period for trichinella testing until the end of twenty thirteen to allow more time for laboratories to become accredited
