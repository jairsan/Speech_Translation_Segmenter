thank you president-in-office for your honesty
you quoted your mother well as a mother can i urge you to stop smoking while sympathising with your plight in the building
if you were in ireland you would be completely out in the cold
my question is have you ever considered giving some leadership and quitting the bad habit and encouraging your senators to follow suit
