mr president as chairman of the delegation for relations with canada i warmly welcome this resolution which is actually a first part of an eu-canada summit
as has been said canada is one of europe's oldest partners and strengthening our relations across the atlantic has become a priority for both sides
again as the noble lady said in her opening remarks discussions are progressing with canada for a comprehensive economic and trade agreement which hopefully will set the standard for future trade agreements between the eu and third countries
parliament will have to approve these agreements and i hope that the commission will keep members especially the interparliamentary delegation and the international trade committee fully informed and involved at each stage of these discussions
the resolution before us is one that i can fully support as it is concise and sticks to the issues of the summit and our relations with the canadian government
the resolution sets a positive tone for future discussions and illustrates this parliament's willingness to engage positively with our oldest trading partner
it can be built upon to advance the reputation not only of this house but also in future negotiations with other third countries
