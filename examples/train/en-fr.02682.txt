mr president i voted against this report
you can keep your thirty pieces of silver
i will not be joining any pan-european party
i will not be selling out my principles as some in this chamber are willing to do
it is not fair that the public once again have to use their resources to fund politicians
politicians should be privately funded through donations etc
and that should be heavily regulated
this chamber found out only recently how politicians do need to be regulated but the funding of political parties for a european ideal can never be right
i will never join a pan-european party
i will stand up for my principles and to hell with the lot of you
