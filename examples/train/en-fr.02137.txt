mr president i welcome this debate on the budget today
these are difficult times in member states and that is a reality that this house cannot ignore
from talking to my constituents it is clear that they believe that those vocalising the need for budget increases are divorced from their economic reality and furthermore the whole issue is eroding confidence in european institutions
the failure to agree a budget is not due to intransigence but is largely due to the federalist agenda and the pursuit of that holy grail the concept of own resources
an eu tax is out of the question in my view
in response to president barroso's declaration today that he will bring forward proposals for such a tax before june of next year i would call on prime minister cameron to clearly state that any move in this direction would trigger a referendum in the united kingdom
