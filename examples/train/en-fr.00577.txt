madam president since its establishment in nineteen ninety-three the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty has fundamentally reshaped the role of international humanitarian law and has provided the victims of the tragic balkan conflicts who would otherwise have gone unheard with an opportunity to voice the horrors that they and their families experienced and to seek justice
the icty has shown that no one whatever their position or status at the time of the conflict is immune from justice a precedent that now sees the international criminal court promote respect for human rights across our world
today we reiterate that for the former yugoslavia there can be no impunity for those indictees who are still being sought
ratko <unk> and goran <unk> are still renegades from justice and must be handed in
we should also give our full support to chief prosecutor brammertz's call for the necessary documentation vital to the case against the former general ante gotovina and others to be made available to the tribunal an issue that our croatian friends amongst others know is pertinent to the eu accession process
the socialist group has proposed two amendments to plenary
firstly that it should be made clear that any proposals for a possible mandate extension should not divert attention from the key task of completing trials and moving towards the earliest possible closure
secondly we appeal for free access to the icty's archives by prosecutors defence counsel and eventually historians and researchers
i thank the rapporteur and i commend these amendments to the house
