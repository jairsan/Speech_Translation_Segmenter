mr president may i congratulate you on your presidency and in particular welcome the fact that in your remarks you have referred to history and others have referred to it as well
you certainly seem to be someone who will value the freedoms which this house wishes to have the freedom of expression but also the freedoms of looking ahead of change and reform in europe and that this house must change and reform with europe
the fact that you have a history of which you are proud and rightfully so from nineteen eighty in <unk> and onwards where you brought poland into nato and then started the negotiations for membership of the european union you are someone who can embrace the changes that europe needs now
we welcome you
we will do our very best to help you in the job that you have taken on
