madam president it was the great philosopher whitney houston who once said i believe that children are our future
teach them well and let them lead the way
show them all the beauty they possess inside
what is interesting about this report is that for the first time we are in many ways looking at the key for future development
we are notably looking for child development and child education and not only female child education if you teach the woman you teach the family but also primary education
there is a simple flaw in our thinking on primary education we always seem to think that the state has the solution
i urge all my colleagues in this house to look at the solutions that have been highlighted by the e g west centre at the university of newcastle which looks at private education for the poor
where the state has failed to provide education for poor children parents themselves have come together finance non-state education and therefore are also able to subsidise the non-working poor
i would urge everyone to look beyond the state for solutions to help the very poorest in our society
