mr president i am surprised that the commissioner seems so optimistic about getting the situation in fukushima under control in a few days when nuclear experts have talked about weeks and months meanwhile the plant is still emitting radiation which is continuing to seep into the food supply and into the water supply
i welcome the call for stress tests but they do not answer the bigger questions
the question is do we want to accept the rising risks of nuclear power in a world where complex natural disasters and extreme weather events are very much on the increase
the safety of nuclear reactors simply cannot be fully guaranteed in the event of a large-scale disaster of any description where there are multiple levels of disruption where you get cuts to electricity to water supply to communications and to physical access
that is the question do we actually want to take this risk when we have other alternatives
