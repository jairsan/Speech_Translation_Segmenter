mr president we did have a brief discussion about this when we voted during the last plenary session
the problem is this when we had the debate with the commission and council it became clear to many of us in the house that it was not appropriate for us to vote on the resolution and we therefore asked for it at that stage to be postponed
i think our view now is that there is no need for a resolution
parliament expressed itself on this subject a couple of months ago that is absolutely sufficient there is no need to do it again at this stage
the debate that we had with the other institutions was valuable but there is no need for a resolution
