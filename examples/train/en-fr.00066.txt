mr president the commission proposal on patients rights to cross-border health care seeks to broaden the rights of patients to obtain treatment abroad if they experience undue delay in receiving treatment at home
a chronic example of undue delay has been brought to my attention recently in my own constituency
children in the hse southern region are being forced to wait up to forty-eight months for orthodontic treatment
moreover waiting times have become even longer over the past three years
it is my sincerest hope that with the cross-border proposal we can work towards shortening such undue delay by making it easier for patients to travel to receive quality treatment on time
ultimately it should be the right of all patients to receive high-quality treatment close to home but in the case of blatant gaps in provision we should have the right to travel freely to receive this necessary treatment abroad
