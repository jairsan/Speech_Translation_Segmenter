madam president a vote was defeated because there was an equal number of votes just a couple of moments ago
a member has made a very serious allegation about voting in the chamber
i would ask you to halt proceedings until we find out whether there are members voting who should not be voting or whether this allegation is false
it is a very serious allegation
