mr president i will not keep you long
today we are voting on the resolutions to approve the executive directors of the european supervisory authorities
issues concerning the overall procedure for the future were dealt with last month in the negotiations surrounding the appointment of the chairs of the authorities
for the banking authority the proposed executive director is adam farkas for the insurance and occupational pensions authority it is carlos montalvo and for the markets authority it is verena ross
the nominees all attended confirmation hearings in the committee on economic and monetary affairs last week
these were webstreamed and are therefore available on the econ website as are the candidates biographies
the full committee decided by a substantial majority that we should vote in favour of these candidates so that is the recommendation from the committee
