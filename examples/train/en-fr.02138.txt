mr president this has been a most important debate particularly the political aspects of it but i think it is also important to talk about some of the practical parts of the debate
i am the rapporteur for agriculture for the twenty eleven budget and there will be real implications if we do not reach agreement on the budget for the cash-flow of member states who have made advance payments to their farmers in recent weeks
these farmers are facing financial difficulties and income shortages
so there are very real and practical implications and this is just one of them
but let me talk about the future
right now we are debating the future of the common agricultural policy and we are asking that policy to deliver more for europe in terms of environmental issues food security and the territorial dimension and yet all of the debate thus far has been about how can we shrink the agriculture budget
i am very concerned that in this debate about budget twenty eleven we are projecting a very negative view of the budget for agriculture and the european union post twenty thirteen
the two are very much linked and i think we need to be aware of that
