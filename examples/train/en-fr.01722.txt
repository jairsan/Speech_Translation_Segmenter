mr president as the shadow rapporteur for my group but also as the chairman of the committee responsible i want also to join in thanks to heide r√ºhle for what is a really important report
indeed it is a shame that under the rather strange rules of this parliament such an important report about a key element of the single market and indeed public policy is confined only to one-minute interventions
i think it is welcome that mr tajani is here because i want to say to him that public procurement is a key instrument for encouraging innovative enterprise across the european union
mr barnier we know is now going to have a look at strategy and i hope will pick up many of these things
but the core of the problem colleagues is that we have a regime which as this report says is confusing and complex and indeed which many public authorities regard as a bureaucratic imposition instead of an opportunity
we can use public procurement to drive forward areas like small and medium-sized enterprises commissioner and opportunities for innovation and green products and services and indeed for supporting the whole of the innovation agenda
that is what we have to achieve but it will need a concerted effort by all arms of the commission to deliver the recommendations in this report
