mr president i am not entirely happy with this report and the manner in which we dealt with it here today but i did nevertheless vote for the report because i believe it reduces red tape
industrial installations make a significant contribution to pollutant emissions in europe but heavy industry is one of the drivers of our economy and needs to be encouraged to produce greener emissions
this is a major issue for my region of the west midlands which is one of the most industrialised in the uk
the integrated approach is welcome but the stringent rules in this report are of concern and i am concerned that the implementation costs should not be so heavy that they undermine the environmental protection provisions
we need checks on the european safety net and we need to look at issues such as the spreading of manure and slurry which i believe would be disproportionate to the environmental benefits we get
administrative burdens and costs have to be proportionate to the environmental benefits because if that is the case we will have a win-win situation which would help businesses meet their environmental commitments bring significant support in the fight against climate change and have the potential to improve health conditions for young and old people across my region
