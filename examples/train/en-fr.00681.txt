madam president feeding the hungry is a basic precept
we rightly talk about it in the context of third countries but rarely acknowledge real hunger in europe
however gnawing hunger and severe malnutrition deficiencies even without actual hunger is a reality even in the most prosperous member states
hunger in the midst of plenty is and has always been a scandal and in this report we are trying to improve schemes to address it more effectively
as an impoverished mother i had reason to be grateful for the free milk given to families of young children in the nineteen seventies in ireland and for the low-cost milk my children received at school in the nineteen eighties
i would like to add one suggestion though but not within the cap
as a result of some of the policies in the common fisheries policy thousands of tonnes of edible fish are dumped dead over the sides of fishing boats around our coasts
it is time we ended this waste
we should land these so-called discards and give the fish to those who need it but cannot afford high-quality protein
it would be very hard to find a better and more nourishing food
commissioner can you speak to the commissioner for fisheries on the extension of this scheme to include fish
