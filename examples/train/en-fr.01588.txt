madam president we can set all the targets under the sun for tackling climate change but we will not reach them especially the longer-term targets for twenty fifty unless we invest deeply and systematically in developing and improving sustainable low-carbon technology
the us is rightly criticised for its failure to sign up to greenhouse gas reduction targets but the eu is nowhere near the level of investment that the us is at at present
without proper investment the eu's sustainable low-carbon investment programme will stall and that means that hundreds of thousands of jobs which could be created here in the eu and in regions like my own the north-east of england which are already starting to make that transformation to a low-carbon economy without investment those jobs will go elsewhere to the us and china
i am disappointed that the commission drew back from an earlier draft of the set plan where the sources of the identified necessary investment were clearly indicated
will the commission now be more explicit especially about the eur one billion per annum shortfall that the commissioner has just mentioned
finally it is of course important to achieve improvements in nuclear technology especially with regard to safety of operation and waste management but my group takes the view that sustainable nuclear fission is a contradiction in terms
will the commissioner rename the sixth european industrial initiative simply the nuclear energy initiative
