madam president mr arlacchi's report is well researched and informative
my slight criticism is that he seems to bemoan the fact that afghanistan is not a liberal democracy run by a coalition of greens and liberal democrats in brighton
the horror story of afghanistan has involved the deaths of three hundred and forty-six british soldiers many more allied soldiers and thousands of innocent afghans
during that period infant mortality and maternal mortality have soared and life expectancy has fallen
he tells us than in two thousand and one no poppies were being grown in afghanistan whereas now after nine years of conflict and allied influence afghanistan supplies more than ninety of the heroin in europe
to point out that there is some discrimination against women is to get things slightly out of proportion
the answer is to support our troops by stopping the war and bringing them home to guard our own people against home grown but imported terrorists
