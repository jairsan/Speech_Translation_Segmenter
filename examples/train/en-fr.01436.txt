madam president firstly i want to say that the commission is to be congratulated on rejecting a recent proposal by the who that we should ban the sale of duty-free alcohol and spirits
if this was accepted it would have cost eur two billion to the european economy and hundreds of jobs across the union
it was a notion based on moralistic preaching rather than on scientific evidence by the who and thankfully it was rejected by the commission
the second point i want to make is that the banks were primarily responsible for many of the ills which we are seeing nowadays but what happened
a new theory came into being they were too big to fail
i think rather than be too big to fail many of them are too big for their own boots
that is seen in the immoral salaries that some of them are getting and the grotesque bonuses they are also getting
no banker should be getting more than the prime minister of his country and we should work towards
