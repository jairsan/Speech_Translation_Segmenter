mr president first of all i would like to congratulate the rapporteur
we have worked in tandem me being last year's rapporteur and that brings me to my first point
it strikes me about these annual debates on competition policy that there is a very friendly and polite exchange of views and then the commission just carries on with business as usual because the commission has the exclusive powers in this area
i think at a time where we are discussing economic governance for the european union that should change
the european parliament should have a much bigger role in shaping competition policies and i therefore urge the commission to follow in particular recommendations three and four and really seriously report back to the european parliament about its recommendations
secondly in my view a report should be more than a mere summary of actions taken
it should be an analysis of the impact of the competition policies and that is currently lacking
you say that you will do one on the temporary state aid framework because that is your priority but we have been calling for such analyses for years on green recovery on state aid to innovation on state aid to public services
that is long overdue so i would ask the commission to do more in-depth analysis
finally i would urgently reiterate the calls we have been making for years now for a sector inquiry into online advertising and search engines
this is really long overdue and i would like to hear from the commission when they intend to conduct such an inquiry
