mr president this legislation will allow the eu to throw money at referendum campaigns to ensure that it purchases the right result first time for a change the uk will in future be holding a referendum each time the eu proposes to remove power from its electorate
the eu is frightened out of its wits that we may give a series of wrong answers
so it intends to remove money from uk taxpayers to indoctrinate them into its version of the path of true righteousness
fronting the legislation is andrew duff a liberal democrat mep from my own region
support in the uk for his party has collapsed recently a party of course desperate for eu institutions to govern the uk
never has the eu's gerrymandering been so clearly displayed alongside its contempt for uk voters
it is sowing the seeds of its own destruction because the legislation will allow us to fund the referendum campaign that many in my country have for a very long time been waiting for the one that gives us the opportunity to remove ourselves entirely from its control
