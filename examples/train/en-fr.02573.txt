mr president there cannot be a greater friend of israel in the european union than germany so it is quite something to read that chancellor merkel has been shouting at prime minister netanyahu saying you have done nothing to promote peace give me something
quite something she is right of course
israel has played for time
it likes talks about talks because all that time gives it the opportunity to keep changing the facts on the ground and making a two-state solution that much harder to achieve
high representative you have the power to make a difference
here is the statement of the european union from last month on the association agreement six pages of condemnation of human rights abuses and illegality and infringements by israel and yet a summary which says we seek closer cooperation with israel
what is this about
is it surprising that palestinians regard the european union as having double standards
you are putting your trust in pleasant dialogue
but israel just thinks we are weak weak weak
and until you use your power until you stand up and use a word to israel which they are not used to hearing nothing will change
that word is no
