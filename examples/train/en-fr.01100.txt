mr president while we sit in this chamber having grand debates the hangmen in iran are working overtime
as we heard from tunne kelam yesterday they hanged another five people including a young woman the parents of whose victim had pardoned her
so she had actually been excused the death penalty but was subsequently hanged
but we follow a policy of appeasement in the eu
only this week we have agreed that we will encourage the russians to enrich the nuclear fuel rods on behalf of ahmadinejad in return for his guarantee that he will stop his own nuclear enrichment programme
but he has not given that guarantee nor has he given open access for inspectors to look at his nuclear facilities
we are only bolstering the mullahs when we continue this policy of appeasement
we need to take tough sanctions
toughness is the only language these mullahs understand
