mr president after copenhagen let us reassess the whole global warming story
at copenhagen we had the irony of not just climategate ii but also the onset of one of the harshest winters in decades
since then we have seen the debunking of the potsdam sea-level scare the goddard institute has been caught fiddling the temperature records the vanishing himalayan glaciers have been exposed as a fantasy mr pachauri has emerged as a climate change profiteer
the world is cooling
global warming is a fraud
this is not a victimless crime
carbon taxes push up fuel prices killing our old folk as we speak
the billions wasted researching this non-existent problem are billions that cannot be spent defeating real scourges such as alzheimer's or ending real environmental disasters such as deforestation
carbon credit trading makes billions for city sharks at the expense of families in poverty
the loss of agricultural land to biofuels has already doubled world food prices so millions are starving while greedy corporations make even fatter profits
those pushing the unscientific nonsense of man-made climate change shell monsanto the international banks bilderberg one-worlders carbon billionaires and their useful idiot allies on the left are running the biggest fraud in human history
they must and will be called to account as should their collaborators in places such as this
