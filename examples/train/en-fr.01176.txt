mr president i particularly wanted to be here this evening because i think that this is mrs kuneva's last opportunity to speak to us as commissioner and i wanted to pose two questions
first of all would she agree with me that consumer information and sweeps and her work have been dramatically increased during her tenure as the first commissioner whose responsibility focused specifically on consumers
secondly would she also agree with me that it is absolutely crucial that in the next commission we continue to have a commissioner who is dedicated to consumer affairs
we have heard disturbing rumours that this might not be the case in the new commission and i wanted to give her the opportunity to give us her views this evening
