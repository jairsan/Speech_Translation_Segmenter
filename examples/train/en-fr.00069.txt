madam president on behalf of my group i would also like to welcome this agreement
we do not feel that we are going to get any more if it goes to conciliation so have supported the rapporteur on this
i admit that in terms of the presidency looking at this as a step forward to social europe we would like to feel that it is a step in that direction
i welcome certainly as a british member some warm words for once about the uk government position
i hope they are going to be equally constructive on other matters in this field that are before the house at the moment
i think it is very important that in the current climate we are actually making progress on workers rights rather than trying to imply that those doing work on a temporary basis are somehow less important as individuals or less important economically
as someone said while some work this way from choice others work in this field because they do not have a choice
for example in a number of rural areas you may find limited employment possibilities with one employer basically handing out most of the jobs
if you as a temporary worker dare to question the conditions in which you find yourself you may actually find that you are never employed by that particular company again
so i think that the legal certainty provided in this agreement is extremely important
it might go some way to help for example a person whom i came across in london the only individual working in a hotel kitchen who was not on a permanent contract was the one whose job was to clean the ovens and to get inside them using heavy-duty chemicals with no training or protective clothing because that worker was only temporary and therefore health and safety did not matter so much
so for people like that this legislation will be extremely important and we look forward to its rapid implementation
