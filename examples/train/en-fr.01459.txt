mr president the military junta has ruled the country through repression and committing gross and systematic human rights violations
as an elected representative of citizens i call for free and fair parliamentary elections in twenty ten to have a legitimate government in burma
the current requirement to have at least twenty-five of the parliament as members of the military selected by the chief of defence services falls outside any common sense vision about what a legitimate government is
second i note that the government of the military junta signed the united nations convention against corruption in two thousand and five but failed to ratify it
ratification however should only be regarded as a first step implementation is the key when it comes to combating corruption
corruption brings poverty and impunity
