mr president the prospect of being jailed for thought crimes is shocking
unlike most of the people here i can tell you that from personal experience
the british government has tried to jail me three times under anti-free-speech laws that state that telling the truth is no defence
so i am very sympathetic to chinese and especially tibetan dissidents forced into slave labour in communist prison camps
steps must be taken to prevent the goods they make being allowed to undercut manufacturing and workers in the west
but if one accepts that items made by forced labour constitute unfair competition it is impossible to avoid the same conclusion about goods made by sweated labour by workers who are not allowed to organise into trade unions in a country where there are no environmental protection costs
the truth is that all manufactured goods from china constitute unfair competition
trade with china far from being free costs millions of jobs and destroys our manufacturing base
it is time to protect our workers from this unholy alliance of communist tyranny and capitalist greed
