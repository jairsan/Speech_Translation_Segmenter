mr president my congratulations on your pronunciation of my rather difficult name the conservatives here and in member states are like naughty children
having stamped their feet for years demanding deregulation of banks and shadow banking they are now prepared to swallow strong regulation but only if we pretend that it was their idea all along
however they are still childishly demanding deregulation of the workplace flexibility meaning no protection no security and cuts in social services
that my friends is a recipe for fanning an uncontrollable forest fire
president in-office topol√°nek chose sweden as a comparison to america
why not the czech republic
why not ireland
simple the irish government is tearing the heart out of health services education childcare and training
it is deepening the sense of insecurity in ireland creating more unemployment when they should be keeping people in work and failing to do anything to help small companies to survive
i believe that there needs to be a change of government in ireland and a change of attitude in the european council
let us have an employment summit for all member states on seven may
