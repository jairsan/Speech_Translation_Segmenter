thank you very much for your reply
i find it amazing that only three states have actually applied
it is unbelievable
i come from a region where we have lost thousands of jobs dell three zero jobs and just today eight hundred jobs have been lost through the pharmaceutical company pfizer three hundred of them in my area which is the south of ireland and that has a gross grant equivalent of zero per cent
our government has reapplied and i am hoping that that will change because if it does not it ensures that the government cannot apply really active measures from a state point of view to bring in larger companies
that to me is very regressive and needs to change
so i will actively look for the commission to pursue a different strategy because i believe that the state aid map is out of date
