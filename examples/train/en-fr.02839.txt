mr president i shall be very brief
first of all i think that this is an important proposal
this impact assessment is important to us for two reasons
one is to ensure that we are passing regulation that is necessary and effective but also to stop blaming something called brussels for everything that goes wrong
national governments and parliaments take responsibility when everything goes right but when it is wrong they blame brussels
i think these impact assessments should show just who is responsible and where the blame lies because it is far too convenient to do that
furthermore when you look back at what happened before we had the european union the cost of that was absolutely devastating
