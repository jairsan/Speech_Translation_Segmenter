madam president i too want to add my voice to those who have condemned the murderous vicious and cowardly attack on the british army barracks in northern ireland and i want to send my heartfelt sympathies to the families of all those who were injured or killed
the particular issue i want to raise this evening is that on wednesday night the commission will issue a statement on its green paper on the eu workforce for health
according to the green paper the key to maintaining a sufficient workforce is to educate recruit and retain young practitioners
yet in ireland we have the very opposite situation with a sixteen point five cut in undergraduate nursing places
in my own region at st angela's college we have a cut of twenty-five for general nursing and forty for intellectual-disability nursing
the commission must put pressure on member states to ensure each country takes responsibility for training its own health-care workforce and that we also have an ethical requirement whereby we do not seek to recruit health-care workers from developing countries and damage their already vulnerable health-care systems
