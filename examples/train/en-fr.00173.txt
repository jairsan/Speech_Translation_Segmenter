i welcome council's remarks and the general approach to the financial services crisis and indeed i hope that we will be able to build on the recent g twenty results
as you mentioned we need to build on that movement to create global results for global regulations and particularly financial supervision
i have to say that financial supervision requires financial support as well
we have seen this
this is taxpayers money of course
but supervision to be appropriate needs appropriate solvency not just for banks but also for insurance companies
i wonder therefore if you will also support group supervision and group support as stated in solvency ii something not mentioned in your list of financial regulations but which was thought up outside a time of crisis and could help us in crisis
if this is the case perhaps the presidency could explain why on two december it intends to delete group support from this proposal and realise how unhelpful this can be
