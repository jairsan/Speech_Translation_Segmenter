mr president i could agree with what mr van orden says about hamas but the fact is that none of what he says justifies the bombing of civilians by israel
that is the fundamental point we have to stop the bombing whether it is coming from hamas or coming from israel
i hope the resolution accompanying this debate will receive a strong vote in this house tomorrow and i hope it will strengthen the hands of the commission and the council in pressuring both israel and hamas to stop the killing
since israel withdrew from gaza it has turned it into the largest prison in the world and for the last three weeks it has turned it into a slaughterhouse illegally using terror against terror killing civilian men women and children and killing the possibility of a viable two-state solution in the process
there can be no upgrading of europe's relations with israel so long as it fails to engage in constructive and substantive negotiations with its neighbours and all the palestinian elected members including hamas
it should be made clear by europe that any escalation of this war on gaza will be followed by an escalation of our reaction to that war
