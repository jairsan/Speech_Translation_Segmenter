madam president i believe we all share the same objective to ensure the long-term viability and competitiveness of the eu car industry and to maintain jobs in the sector
in july i wrote to commissioner verheugen and i was encouraged by receiving his commitment to ensure a level playing field in any restructuring plan for the european arm of gm
in my region the vauxhall plant in ellesmere port is the linchpin of the local economy employing some two two hundred direct jobs
the site has undergone radical restructuring and is considered a lean efficient and competitive operation as indeed is the luton site in the south-east of england
nobody wants job losses but any decision must be based on the viability and efficiency of plants
it must be based on fairness not favouritism not because one member state has pledged more finance than any others
and i am pleased that commissioner kroes recognises that there is no place for political fixes political strings or conditions in awarding state aid
i urge the commission to be vigilant and to ensure that any financial support is based on state aid rules and the ability of the european operations to be commercially viable and economically fit for the future
maintaining a strong european car industry means taking a pan-european approach to maintaining vital and efficient infrastructure in all member states and all regions
