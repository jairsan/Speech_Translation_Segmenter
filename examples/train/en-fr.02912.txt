mr president although the united kingdom is not a member of the euro zone and i hope it never will be we have a vested interest in its success
i wish the euro zone well and i regret that i am unable to support the proposals on economic governance we are debating tonight
the proposals before us grant the commission sweeping new powers
had these powers been limited to euro zone countries alone i would not have objected but instead we see the commission and many members in this parliament including ms wortmann-kool for whom i have the utmost respect using the crisis in the euro zone as an excuse to extend the power of the eu into the economic governance of the united kingdom and other countries who do not use the euro
i was not elected to grant the eu more powers over the way the united kingdom governs its affairs and i shall therefore vote against these proposals
