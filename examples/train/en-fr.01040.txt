mr president wales is currently a major beneficiary of eu funding under the two thousand and seven twenty thirteen structural funds programme
the money is largely directed towards developing sustainable economic growth and creating jobs
west wales and the valleys receives the highest level of support under the current structural funds and rightly so
many regard the uk as a wealthy place to live
very few people know the reality of the scale of poverty and unemployment in wales
the valleys have all but been destroyed by the closure of big industries which at one point were the backbone of solid hardworking communities
today the mines are closed
the factories that grew up in their place are outsourcing work overseas
the communities that thrived on this employment have not just lost their jobs but also their sense of purpose and belonging
with more and more countries queuing up to join the eu i am worried that wales will see much-needed support go to newer member countries
i urge the commission and the council to ensure that wales receives adequate funding through a strong transitional settlement when the current round of structural funds ceases in twenty thirteen
