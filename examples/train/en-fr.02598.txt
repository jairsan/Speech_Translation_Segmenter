mr president i understand the urgency of the commission in addressing the economic crisis and the high levels of debt which are a threat for the stability of the euro
i understand that conditions are imposed on countries that have to make use of the european financial stability mechanism
however it seems to me that the commission is being quite selective in the measures and conditions it deems permitted in this crisis
on the one hand nearly any measure seems legal when it comes to fiscal consolidation by cutting expenditure
as soon as ireland made use of the rescue package minimum wages and pension levels were the first variables to be adjusted despite the fact that these matters explicitly are not eu competences
on the other hand the commission hides itself behind the lack of eu competence to leave the exceptionally low irish corporation tax untouched whereas increasing this could also substantially improve public revenues in ireland
cutting expenditure is not after all the only way to achieve a balanced budget
i understand that this crisis requires exceptional measures but why is the commission in such a hurry to adjust minimum wages affecting workers who earn the least while we have to wait and see about measures that make the banking and financial sector pay
i strongly get the feeling that the commission is interpreting the eu's competences in a very one-sided and dare i say it right-wing manner
this blunt approach inspires euro-scepticism
it seems that the eu acts firmly in the field of employment and social policy only in times of crisis and then does so by imposing cuts in social spending and wages
the eu can only regain confidence if the commission shows the same determination in setting proper minimum social standards and social guarantees for the heavy cuts imposed on people
yes we do want economic governance but we want balanced governance with both fiscal sustainability and social guarantees
if not the vulnerable will pay the price for a mess that they are not responsible for
