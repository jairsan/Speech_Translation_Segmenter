mr president i have listened to the views of the honourable members with great interest
many of you have affirmed the direction being taken by the commission
others have underlined and emphasised many points that we have noted to make sure that they are all taken into consideration in the deliberations and discussions that we will be having on this revision of the directive
i would like to assure you that the commission takes these issues very seriously and is determined to find the best solutions for the way forward
we are now in the middle of a consultation process
we are analysing the feedback we gathered from the recent online public consultation
consumers businesses organisations and member states have all contributed
moreover i can inform you that the commission will host a stakeholders workshop on twenty-two april twenty ten
this workshop will focus on possible policy options for the revision of the package travel directive including all the issues that have been mentioned during this debate
i must stress that it is as yet too early to decide the way forward
it is essential to respect the impact assessment procedure
however i am determined that any action should aim at ensuring a high level of protection for the eu's citizens
before i close may i once again thank all those present for contributing to this debate
thank you very much
