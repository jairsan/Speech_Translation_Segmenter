mr president the debate is essential because by making the single market work more effectively we have the potential to create economic growth which fundamentally results in the creation of jobs
i was pleased that a compromise has been reached on the subject of the social clause
the balance between the market and our social values is vitally important to have lost this principle would have been deeply damaging
on the digital agenda although many member states are making progress it is sadly also seen by many as non-essential
if member states do not deliver on this agenda the competitiveness of the whole eu suffers
what pressure can be brought to bear to ensure that no eu citizen wherever he or she lives is left behind in this digital revolution which surrounds us
finally on public procurement i welcome the commission's proposals
however how do we ensure that innovative public procurement is at the heart of our agenda
