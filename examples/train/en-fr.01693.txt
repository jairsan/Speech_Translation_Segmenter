madam president delaying ratifying the lisbon treaty meant that seven hundred and thirty-six meps were appointed rather than the seven hundred and fifty-one now proposed
this higher number is to be achieved by eighteen seats being distributed amongst twelve member states and germany losing three seats but this cannot take place as it is unlawful to prematurely curtail the mandate of the three german meps
a further complication is that the treaty stipulates the total number of meps shall not exceed seven hundred and fifty-one
to include the eighteen additional meps without losing the three german seats will require a revision of protocol thirty-six of the lisbon treaty
this should be achieved by a convention producing proposals for agreement by member states for incorporation into the treaty by way of amendment
failure to do this would render unlawful any act this parliament takes on the basis of a seven hundred and fifty-four strong chamber three over the limit of seven hundred and fifty-one
the proposal before this house is that this problem be dealt with by way of an intergovernmental conference but this is a significant revision and amendment to the lisbon treaty requiring ratification by all member states and providing the opportunity for individual national referenda
i urge this house to oppose this proposal
