mr president the members have for their consideration a draft decision supplementing the schengen borders code as regards the surveillance of the external borders in the context of frontex operations at sea
this is a necessary decision and it will help member states and frontex to manage our external sea borders more efficiently
as you know the number of boats will increase very soon as they always do at this time of year in the mediterranean
the proposal contains a set of very important principles and clarifications of rules that border guards must apply when controlling sea borders for example the principle of non-refoulement and the obligation to treat vulnerable peoples and unaccompanied minors with special care
it also clarifies what assistance should be provided to persons in danger at sea and where to disembark persons that are rescued
many of you in this house have asked for these principles and rules for years and now finally they are within our reach
the changes that we are proposing will also reduce the risk of lives being lost in the mediterranean by making sea border operations more efficient
the draft decision is the result of very hard and long discussions with member states and with experts from for instance the united nations high commissioner for refugees and the international organisation for migration
it will provide our institutions with a better framework for exercising a proper monitoring of these operations where significant european funds are involved
on the legal aspects of the proposal the commission has chosen article twelve of the schengen border code as the legal basis because the rules concern border surveillance patrols during frontex operations not border checks as i think parliament's legal opinion argues
at the request of members of this house the commission has made an investigation of alternative technical solutions that would allow for firstly not reopening the discussions on the substance and secondly having clear rules adopted in time for frontex operations this summer
unfortunately we have not found such an alternative so i therefore recommend the honourable members not to reject these long-awaited new rules
