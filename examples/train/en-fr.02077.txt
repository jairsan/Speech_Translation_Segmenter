mr president well president barroso you are certainly flexing your muscles using the powers given to you by the lisbon treaty which you pushed through using illegitimate means
you now do everything you can on the world stage and within the eu to acquire all the attributes of statehood
nowhere could that be more apparent than in your recent proposal for a direct tax to be levied by the european institutions on the peoples of this continent
of course in previous times there was a very successful independence movement that campaigned on the slogan of no taxation without representation and you certainly are not a representative
we have not voted for you and we cannot remove you so i think with this direct tax you have actually made a mistake
and what an expensive club it is becoming
just two years ago britain's net contribution was gbp three billion a year
this year it is gbp six billion
next year it will be gbp eight billion
the year after that it is due to be gbp ten billion and now we hear that you want to take away the british rebate
you want to get rid of the british rebate which will mean by twenty thirteen our contribution will be gbp thirteen billion
it will have quadrupled in the space of six years
the taxpayers of britain realising all of this seeing your direct tax will simply conclude that we cannot afford the european union
but i do see a ray of hope the deauville deal between merkel and sarkozy the thing that you are all so terrified of today
i hope it happens
let us have a new treaty
you yourself seem to be almost supporting it
let us have a new european treaty and let us put it to a referendum in lots of countries particularly in britain and the british people will conclude that this is a very bad deal for britain
they will vote for us to leave the european union and begin the unravelling
thank you
we are happy to go
