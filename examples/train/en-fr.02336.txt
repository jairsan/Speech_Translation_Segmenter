mr president the importance of healthcare and this directive cannot be overemphasised
it can have fundamental consequences for member states health systems
the areas that are controversial and worrying have been dealt with i am pleased to say and the result is a strong defining directive that will strengthen member state positions in healthcare
the challenge was to protect the integrity of healthcare systems while offering patients greater choice
the need for member states to retain control over the policy direction and budgetary requirements of their health services was met by the pre-authorisation clause and the fact that member states would choose which services were carried out
e-health was also dealt with in a very sensible fashion in that it is offered in order to provide flexibility and member states can pick it up if they wish and when they wish
overall we have before us a piece of work that secures member states autonomy in their health systems while offering patients best service
i congratulate the rapporteur and john bowis for a job well done
