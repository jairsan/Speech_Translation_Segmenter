mr president i think all of us have been very deeply shocked and appalled by the assassination of minister shahbaz bhatti not least because he is someone known to us in this parliament he has visited here he has met many of us but also because this is another highly symbolic killing striking at someone who was looking for reconciliation and work across all minorities in pakistan
we should also add our condolences not only to his family but also to all the families of those who have been killed in terrorist attacks in pakistan
this week we have seen two such attacks which have killed and injured more people than for example the london bombings
the whole population is suffering and intimidation is undermining democracy in pakistan
we are seeing a change in the demographics of certain constituencies for example quetta as intimidation works to force people out
our resolution is important in terms of wanting to continue and support the work in terms of tolerance and mutual understanding
i would like to make the point that we need that in the european union too where certain recent ministerial statements in my view have not helped that
so we expect leadership in pakistan and in the european union
