mr president foremost in my mind at the moment as i prepare for the ad hoc delegation to tunisia tomorrow which i am delighted to be part of is the well-being of the tunisian people and the need for all of us to remember how important it is and why we respect their cultural values and their identity as we help them build a new future based on the rule of law and democratic ideals
people expect change and they expect aid without strings
i am so glad that mr cohn-bendit has followed up the point i made in the delegation committee this morning about exactly what has happened to the eu money over all these years
the eas representative there said that it was spent on reforms
what reforms
if there were adequate reforms the people would not have revolted in the way they did
can we have some truthful answers
we need to push the provisional government to investigate where that money went and make sure that any eu money in the future is rightfully spent
