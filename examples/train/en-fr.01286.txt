madam president to read the eu action plan for afghanistan and pakistan you would imagine that the whole situation depended on what the eu does
i believe the european union could make a useful practical contribution but this needs to be set in the context of the wider international effort and it should be focused on some specific activities where eu involvement might add real value
it is too serious for eu posturing
in a document of over a dozen pages i found only four brief references to the united states and more significantly perhaps only one to nato and it is after all the nato isaf mission which is central to the success of all endeavours
without security and stability it is not possible to ensure good governance or any meaningful programme of reconstruction and development
on the civil side european countries and the eu itself have pumped eur eight billion into afghanistan since two thousand and one but this huge sum seems to have made little difference do we have any idea how much of it has gone astray
there needs to be a comprehensive international plan for afghanistan and pakistan but i have yet to see where the eu contribution fits into this wider international commitment
