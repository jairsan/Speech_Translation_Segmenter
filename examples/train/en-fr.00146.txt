mr president earlier this year we saw the failure of the burmese government to deal with the consequences of a natural disaster in that country
considering the amount of money spent by the military on its own upkeep and the tight hold it has on national life one might at least have expected it to be able to respond to the needs of its own people in a humanitarian crisis
it did not because it has no real function except to perpetuate its own existence and stranglehold on power
referring back to what i said in my previous remarks on the congo i wonder how many of the military junta have bank accounts in western banks and enjoy shopping trips to london paris and rome
a direct way of showing support for the burmese people would be for democratic countries to stop them coming until human rights and democracy are practised in burma
