mr president i would like you to report back to the bureau and i speak as chairman of the committee on the internal market because two of the lead commissioners for my committee have not had the chance this evening to respond to questions both from members of my committee and others
if you knew at the beginning of this sitting as you clearly did and the sessions secretariat did that time was going to be limited first of all it was absolutely unnecessary to take the two questions at the beginning that were not allocated to any commissioner
members of this house table questions specifically to the commissioners because they are here and so those two could have been dispensed with straightaway
if this arises again i suggest we have to have a proper change to the rules of procedure on this subject
secondly it was quite clear what time was available in which case you should have shared the questions between the three commissioners who have taken the trouble and have the courtesy to come here
it is outrageous that this parliament ignores the fact that two commissioners come here and will not now get any time
so as chairman of a committee i insist that you as president of this sitting report back fully to the bureau and express our strong displeasure at the appalling organisation of this sitting
