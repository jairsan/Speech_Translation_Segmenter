madam president mr batten is right
the irish government horribly mismanaged our country and it is a sad day for the irish people that we are mentioned in this chamber in these particular circumstances
but we are in a situation where we need solidarity
perhaps mr batten does not understand that word or that ireland needs england as much as england needs ireland and its economy
we are all very much interlinked let us not forget that
can i just ask some questions
because in these emotional times we need some cool heads and clear information
where stand the bank stress tests this evening when the irish banks appear to be absolutely overstretched and stressed out
secondly there is a question for the ecb to answer about what its mandate is
i think that was inferred in the opening remarks because there are interlinked relationships between all banks
those banks from germany and france and other countries who invested in irish banks need to look at what they did and why they did it
lastly there is political instability this evening in ireland
it is regrettable but it is necessary that we have a general election
