mr president i would like to thank thijs berman for his report
it points out an important aspect in development aid that the commission should in my opinion seriously consider
activities such as cultural scientific and economic exchange programmes citizen-to-citizen contacts or political dialogue are regrettably not covered by existing european legislation those being just a few examples
the european union has set up numerous programmes and financial instruments under the auspices of different agencies each covering only certain limited aspects of the problems that the developing countries are currently facing
i find that without a central european union agency and a comprehensive and coherent policy the efforts that we are making to improve the situation in developing countries are not of notable extent
we all agree that the purpose of the european union development cooperation policy is to reach as many people in need as possible but yet we have chosen a rather inconvenient path to that goal
at the moment the european union is both institutionally fragmented and legally hindered as far as development aid is concerned
this much appreciated report deals with the results of those deficiencies
the european union and its member states have contributed immensely to the official development assistance and it should never be underestimated but much remains to be done to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the institutional framework as well as congruence of the legislation covering development aid
