mr president once again i voted in favour of this report because i believe if we are to make strides in fighting climate change we need to make choosing green products easier for the consumer
although my region the west midlands is one of the only landlocked areas of the uk we are of course consumers of fish and fish products which this report refers to
by introducing a voluntary scheme such as ecolabels we can encourage a market in more energy-efficient and ecologically kinder goods
this will fit in with other market-based solutions to climate change such as tax reductions on eco-friendly goods
my constituents tell me that they are happy to make different choices if buying them and buying green products makes it easier for them
we will need to publicise the scheme better if it is to have the desired effect and it will require better marketing but also standardisation and harmonisation of the information it displays if it is to be of real use to consumers
a good model is the report on energy efficiency of tyres which i have been working on and which presents similar details in a clear concise manner
