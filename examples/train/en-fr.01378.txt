mr president i am representing the high commissioner and i am representing the commission
the massacre in maguindanao on the island of mindanao on twenty-three november last year in which fifty-seven people were killed has highlighted long-standing human rights issues in the philippines related to the disappearance or unexplained killing of citizens and the effective impunity for the perpetrators in the past
on this occasion the government has acted swiftly and has taken decisive action to prosecute the perpetrators
that is very welcome
it is important to break the culture of impunity about such killings and to put an end to them
the government has taken some important steps in strengthening human rights
the current administration of president arroyo has abolished the death penalty and with asean has advocated including human rights provisions in the recently adopted asean charter
an objective still to be achieved is ending the forty year-old conflict with muslim rebels in mindanao on the basis of a peace deal that is fair to all sides
there appears to be renewed progress and hopes have risen for agreement later this year
it should be noted that the massacre in maguindanao took place between political families all muslim by the way and that as such it was not related to intercommunal conflicts
the eu has a well-established dialogue with the government of the philippines where both sides discuss a wide range of issues including human rights
we are also negotiating a pca with the philippines which will include important human rights commitments
we actively support the government in its efforts to improve respect for human rights
in agreement with the government we have launched an eu-philippines justice assistance mission
this is a very timely action aimed at capacity-building for the philippines judicial authorities including police and military personnel to help them investigate cases of extrajudicial killings and to prosecute those guilty of murder
we shall also put in place a monitoring system to develop confidence
epjust has an initial duration of eighteen months and is funded under the instrument for stability but can be extended
furthermore we have ongoing projects at local level to promote respect for human rights
these include monitoring of the implementation of international commitments actions to support the ratification of the rome statute of the icc and voter education
the eu is also helping in the mindanao peace process for the moment mainly through support for social services and confidence-building activities but we stand ready to do more if the process advances
