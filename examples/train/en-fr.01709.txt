mr president may i ask you why so many members are allowed to speak loudly and rudely in private conversations when other members are trying to express themselves
i abstained on the resolution on kyrgyzstan
five years ago the people of kyrgyzstan mobilised for the tulip revolution against the corrupt regime and for a better life for themselves
the bakiyev government that came to power unfortunately dismally betrayed the hopes of a better life for the masses instituting a corrupt and authoritarian regime
the new government is made up unfortunately of cronies of bakiyev and has no credence in terms of a new life for the people of the region
i support my fellow socialists from the committee for workers international in the region who call for elections to a new parliament but make clear that nothing will change unless workers and the rural masses have their own candidates and independent working class party to reverse the disastrous privatisations of the last twenty years to tackle neoliberal capitalism and to institute real democratic change and new institutions controlled by working people and with genuine planning of the economy and a socialist federation of central asia
