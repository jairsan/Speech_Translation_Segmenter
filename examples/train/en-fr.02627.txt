mr president the existing directive of two thousand and five on international protection is to be recast as the reception directive for asylum seekers
the new reception directive is a development of the eu's common immigration and asylum policy as laid out under the lisbon treaty
the new directive is intended to set up a new system for deciding the criteria for asylum seekers who can and cannot enter member states and qualify for refugee status and under what conditions
it is intended to harmonise member states asylum policy and give more rights and privileges to those seeking asylum
the current influx of people from north africa is of course just another beneficial crisis that gives the eu another opportunity to extend its power and dominion
immigration and asylum policy should be the sole prerogative of the independent sovereign nation state
this proposed directive is the lisbon treaty doing exactly what its opponents said it would do which of course is why you refused to give the people of europe a referendum on it
