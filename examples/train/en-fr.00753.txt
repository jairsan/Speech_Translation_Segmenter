mr president as the rapporteur of the committee on the internal market and consumer protection on this report i am very proud of the work that we did in introducing more transparency
one of the big problems for many years has been the issue of bill shock for a number of consumers when they return home to find a larger than expected bill
however if we look at the rest of the report and particularly the issue of price caps i think we should recognise that without this regulation prices have been falling anyway
the commission itself admits on its own figures that most consumers do not roam seventy of consumers do not roam at all during a year
the level for regular roamers is much lower
so what we are really doing is reducing call costs and data costs for a privileged few meps commission officials european journalists and european businessmen
let us hope that companies when they try to regain that revenue from elsewhere do not start charging domestic users and particularly the poor more for their calls
let us hope that we are not robbing the poor to pay for cheaper calls for the rich
