mr president the human rights situation in russia has changed for the worse
we now call on the russian authorities to do everything in their power to ensure the protection of human rights defenders
we know that the crucial thing that is lacking is a will to do that everything
it can be done as the kremlin exercises a decisive influence on russia's power structures and judiciary
because of this the failure of the russian judiciary to protect human rights defenders makes one assume the complicity of the regime in these crimes
our message today should be addressed to the eu governments and the commission
as long as the kremlin assumes that worries about the fate of human rights defenders remain on the level of declarations with no consequences on economic relations mr putin and mr medvedev can conclude that the eu has not been able to draw lessons from the blatant murder of anna politkovskaya
