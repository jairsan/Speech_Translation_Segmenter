minister i am sure that in your country as in ireland voters sense and worry about the orwellian feel to the eu at the moment
they are not stupid and they know that the commission gerrymandered its legislative agenda so that no bad news entered the irish media's bloodstream
it is a shame that mr mitchell mr corbett and others are so blinded by the glittering prizes of being successful eurocrats that they miss the point that the people of ireland have delivered their decision
perhaps sir you could get the council to instruct the commission to stop the massive growth of its communication and information otherwise known as propaganda departments and allow the results delivered by the wonderful irish people to stand and prove that democracy lives in the european union
