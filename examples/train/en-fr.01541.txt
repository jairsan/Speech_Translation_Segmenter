you will be aware that the leaked emails from the university of east anglia reveal that historical changes in temperature have been manipulated by supporters of the man-made climate change hypothesis by subjectively choosing base years
that trick has been used to disguise recent falls in temperature and to contain the problem of the medieval warm period
the emails also reveal that scientists sceptical of the hypothesis have been squeezed out of peer review processes to avoid flaws in research being revealed to public scrutiny
can a hypothesis that depends on manipulation of data be a proper basis for justifying enormous expenditure and the closing-down of factories such as the corus plant in middlesbrough
the european union pays enormous subsidies to environmental pressure groups that agree to advise the eu to follow a policy to which it is already committed
is it appropriate for the european union to use public funds to subsidise pressure groups
this wastes public money gives bogus support for european union policies and compromises the independence of campaigning organisations
