mr president at the outset can i ask the services to note that on paragraph thirty-one the first part of my vote should have been in favour
i suggest that this report could have done more for areas of disability that need more work
on that note however i am happy that parliament chose to support my amendment forty-two which urges the commission to make sure that money goes only to member states who meet the criteria of the un convention when it comes to deinstitutionalisation
this is a key issue for me and for many people in this house
there are many issues in this report as others have said that are for subsidiarity and not for the european union which does not legislate on abortion and should not and will not be legislating on abortion
so i could not support the overall report
instead i abstained because i believe the disability amendment is important for those of us who care for those who do not speak have no voice and are not listened to
