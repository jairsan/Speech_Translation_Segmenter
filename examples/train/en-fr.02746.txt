mr president the explosion at chernobyl was a disaster but let us keep it in perspective sixty-four people were killed by chernobyl radiation over twenty-three years and it caused an unknown proportion of six thousand cases of thyroid cancer
these are tragic figures but they pale into insignificance compared to the death toll on our roads
yet while no one is using road traffic accidents to campaign to ban the motor car a small army of leftists is using chernobyl to push for an end to nuclear power
i do not doubt that they mean well but the road to hell is paved with good intentions
the same people meant well when they helped to create the biofuels rush pushing the price of food beyond the reach of the world's poor
tonight millions of children will go to bed slowly dying of hunger because people on that side of the house meant well that is what the fuzzy ideals of the utopian left do in the real world
the impact of a nuclear ban would be even worse because the alternative to nuclear power is not wind farms and solar panels
in our energy-scarce post-peak oil world the alternative to reactors is mass starvation
