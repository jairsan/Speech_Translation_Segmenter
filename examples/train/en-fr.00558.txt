madam president i was the shadow rapporteur on the sacconi report into co emissions from passenger vehicles and i can see from the work that i did on that that we do need to reduce our dependence on oil
we need to reduce that dependence because most oil supplies are of course in very unstable and unsavoury parts of the world
for far too long our thirst for oil has sustained regimes that are deeply inimical to everything that we stand for to our own interests and to our own values especially with regard to human rights and good governance
particularly of course we need to reduce our dependence on russian oil supplies
russia has shown in the past that it will not hesitate to use its control of much of our energy supply to achieve political and economic goals and we need to do all we can to reduce their ability to do so and to do that we of course need to reduce our dependence on oil
