mr president from the discussions i do see a general support for the main objective of the commission proposal which is to provide the legal basis for the computerisation of excise procedures by april twenty ten
i want to emphasise and confirm that the purpose of the proposal is to simplify and modernise the excise procedure to improve control of the movement of excise goods and at that same time to reduce red-tape excise obligations for traders and to reduce the burden on private travellers
these were the guiding principles for the proposals
i would like to make some observations in relation to the amendments concerning some of the more sensitive issues in the proposal
on the guide levels the commission could accept to maintain guide levels as a tool although we did not want to introduce or propose guide levels
however the present quantitative reference values have to be kept
we cannot accept a reduction of these values which would be a step backwards in comparison with the nineteen ninety-three directive
on the abolition of tax-free shops at land borders which is another sensitive issue i want to remind you that the origin of this approach dates back to as early as nineteen sixty when the wco the world customs organisation recommended the abolition of land-border tax-free shops and i also want to remind you that in two thousand and two when the accession talks with ten new countries were completed countries like slovenia hungary and some others were forced to abolish their land-based tax-free shops so i think that the proposed solution which provides a very long transitional period for greece and for romania is quite fair in comparison to the stand taken with regard to the former new countries
on the reimbursement of excise duty to small fuel distributors the commission maintains the principle that the insolvency of the final consumer cannot be a ground not to charge excise duty
at the same time in view of the ongoing economic crisis and sometimes remaining high fuel prices and to ensure fuel distribution to end users it should be possible for member states to otherwise safeguard the interest of small distributors provided that such measures do not disturb competition
concerning the impact assessment a point which many speakers raised i want to remind you that an impact assessment was already made in two thousand and four so we simply did not find it necessary to repeat it two years later
in conclusion i would like to thank parliament for its support and constructive approach
providing the legal basis for the new excise movement control system will allow the member states to speed up their preparation for the introduction of the system foreseen by april twenty ten
the commission will take all necessary steps to ensure that all central systems will be operational by that date as well as provide support to allow a smooth transition to the new paperless environment
