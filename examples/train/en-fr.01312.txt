mr president the spanish presidency is in fact launching a new institution in the european union the trio presidency
there have of course been earlier trios but this is the first to have elaborated a coordinated programme and equally the first under the lisbon treaty
the two other member states making up the trio presidency are belgium and hungary
from the hungarian perspective what is particularly valuable in the new institution is the opportunity to offer our own distinctive contribution to the process
among other questions to be dealt with by the trio presidency and of particular concern is the growing problem of water shortage in europe
for the first time in its history europe is facing a potential water shortage
given its strategic location hungary is uniquely placed to put this issue on the european agenda
