madam president on nineteen january in answer to joe higgins mr barroso declared here in this chamber that europe is trying to support ireland
with the abject capitulation of the new fine gael labour government to the interests of the bondholders it is clear that it is not the council or the commission that are doing the supporting but it is the working class in ireland and in europe which is being forced to support european banks and speculators through paying for their losses
the proposals for economic governance represent an attempt to entrench cutbacks and wage cuts
the scoreboard on austerity and the proposals for fines of hundreds of millions of euro are designed to ensure that regardless of mass opposition working people pay for the crisis
this european shock doctrine will be facilitated by a change to the treaties on which the establishment in europe and ireland are determined to avoid a referendum
the socialist party and the left in ireland will demand a referendum on this proposal for permanent austerity
