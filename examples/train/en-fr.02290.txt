mr president i would like to ask a question of mr posselt for whom i have enormous respect
i am not an international lawyer but i can see no evidence whatsoever that international law forbids caning
it is very clear that it forbids war crimes crimes against humanity genocide and so on but caning in my view is not forbidden by international law
the convention on torture which malaysia has not actually ratified says that caning could amount to torture but is not always necessarily torture
so could bernd perhaps explain to me why caning is illegal as he stated again and as it is stated in the resolution and against international law
if we do not stick to the facts we bring this house into disrepute in my view
