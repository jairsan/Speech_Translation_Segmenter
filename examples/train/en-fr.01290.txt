mr president i thank the commissioner for his statement which certainly reassures me
can i say commissioner that i agree with you absolutely we cannot pull out we cannot create a vacuum because a vacuum exists there already and that is a vacuum of political will and we need political leadership to resolve this according to international obligations as well as according to the rule of law
let me just deal with the reality of this
in the conflict since nineteen ninety-eight over five zero four hundred people have lost their lives and indirectly or directly as many as forty-five zero deaths occur every month
it is reported that there are one four hundred and sixty zero internally displaced people most of them facing violence and let me give a voice to those who do not have a voice those who suffer such violence
the armed actors in the democratic republic of congo drc have perpetrated gender-based violence through various forms including sexual slavery kidnapping forced recruitment forced prostitution and rape
the congolese victims of sexual violence include women men and boys who have also suffered rape sexual humiliation and genital mutilation
resolution after resolution has been passed
the time has come for us internationally to demand an end to these atrocities
