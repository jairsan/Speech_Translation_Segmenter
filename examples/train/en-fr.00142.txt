madam president we need to ensure that consumers all over the eu are adequately protected against aggressive selling tactics by rogue traders operating in the timeshare and holiday product markets
the need for action at eu level is all the more crucial because of the cross-border nature of most timeshare contracts
furthermore we need to ensure that consumers have enough confidence in the regulatory framework so that they do not refrain from purchasing timeshare abroad from legitimate traders
a healthy market in timeshare and similar holiday products will contribute to boosting growth and job creation in the european union
it is my firm belief that the compromise package that you will vote on today will make an important contribution to the achievement of these aims
the amendments put forward by the alde ppe-de and pse groups with which the council has agreed are in my view fair and reasonable
the package is also in line with the commission's original proposal
in my opinion this package constitutes the best option in the interest of both consumers and traders
a vote for this package is a vote for consumer confidence in holiday products for clear consumer information and for a competitive and responsible holiday industry
i therefore look to the members of this house to vote to support an agreement today on rules for timeshare and similar holiday products which will provide real added value for holidaymakers all over europe
