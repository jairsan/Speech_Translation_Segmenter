madam president i would like to raise my concerns about the ever-increasing lack of scientific rigour in the draft proposals presented to this parliament by the commission and indeed in some of the reports and amendments for which we as parliamentarians are responsible
good science gives way more and more to populist and emotive responses often dressed up as the precautionary principle
take the issue of the plant protection products
we have abandoned the scientific principle of risk assessment
there is no detailed eu impact assessment and there is a lack of scientific definition of endocrine disrupters and an inconsistency of treatment between it and the reach directive
we are bringing eu legislation into international disrepute and undermining its credibility by this growing lack of scientific rigour and lack of good science
