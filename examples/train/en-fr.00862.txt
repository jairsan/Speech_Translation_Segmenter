madam president the internet has changed the world as we know it
information that would have been difficult or impossible to find is now only seconds away but the defining characteristic of the internet is not speed or technology it is freedom freedom to express opinions freedom to exchange ideas and freedom to share information
some are advocating a restricted future one where free movement of data is stemmed where big business is allowed to stifle innovation and where internet providers become gate-keepers
we have seen this approach before in china
i hope we choose to retain the freedom that has brought such success and changed our world for the better
at a time when economies need all the help they can get we need to choose openness for progress not short-term protectionism for profit
on behalf of my constituents i will vote for our freedom of information and our future free access to internet for all lawful use
in so doing i will vote for democracy and an economy with opportunities for everyone
