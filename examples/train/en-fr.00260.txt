mr president i just want to add my voice to those who congratulate mr busuttil on his reports and deplore the antics of the various directory guides
one aspect which is often not known is the way in which these guides follow up their demands for payments in an aggressive way
victims of the european city guide and other guides have set up a website called stop the european city guide to help spread awareness of the dangers of these scams and to help small businesses sports clubs charities etc
who are the victims to fight back and not to be conned by them
yet the owners of these guides have bullied them and tried to have that website pulled by the internet service provider that gives them this facility
as a result of that i now host that website on my own website because they apparently do not dare to attack a member of the european parliament
but i would urge those who are victims or potential victims of this scam to make use of that organisation to coordinate their activities and to work with us to plug the legislative loopholes that will finally bring an end to all of these scams
