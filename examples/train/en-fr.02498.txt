mr president a free trade agreement cannot only be about tariffs
it also has to be about intellectual property rights
a business in my constituency avon protection is a world leader in the manufacture of gas masks
avon believes that its patents have been infringed by a south korean firm making what are quite simply copies
there is meant to be patent protection in south korea but will a korean court really find in favour of a british company against a korean business
for free trade to work there has to be a level playing field and yes a safeguard clause such as pablo zalba bidegain's is useful but the other signatory must also ensure that the agreement is indeed a two-way street otherwise the free trade agreement which should benefit both parties simply becomes completely one-sided
