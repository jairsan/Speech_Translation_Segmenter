madam president let us start with the good news
yes there are signs of some recovery in parts of europe's wider economy
but this is being threatened by the prolonged uncertainly which risks drying up funding and stalling investments
everyone in europe including the uk has a vested interest in the strength of the euro area's economy
robust and transparent economic planning to control profligate government spending and unsustainable debt levels is a vital part of this for all twenty-seven countries
the eurozone countries have realised the need for a permanent crisis resolution but there are many questions some of which are addressed in this parliament's resolution
firstly what should be the nature of private sector involvement
i welcome the suggestion of following the imf precedent to protect public money with preferred creditor status
secondly what treaty changes are you talking about
this issue needs to be clarified
and finally the permanent crisis mechanism has been described as a tool to strengthen the eurozone
those countries who seek to join the euro should be given the option to participate but those of us who have elected not to join should not be forced to contribute
