i think your merging of the two questions left me short if you may because my question is very specific
first of all i am not sure that there was full cooperation with this high-level group but i would like to know what progress if any has been made and when they will report because it seems to me that europe is more about activity on gm than on action and what we need is action because we have a situation where a very large country like the us and others are very happy about the way they assess gm and europe wants different criteria
i hear from your answer that you are looking for much more strict whatever that might mean and therefore leave us with the same problem
