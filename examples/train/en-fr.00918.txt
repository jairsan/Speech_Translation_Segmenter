mr president last year i served as a monitor at commemorations for the nineteen fifty-six revolution in budapest
i can confirm that dr morvai is right to criticise those who fret about iran while ignoring human rights abuses here in europe
i trust that no ecr group members here will be hypocritical enough to condemn iran for the use of violence in elections when david cameron is among the sponsors of unite against fascism an organisation of far-left criminals which routinely deploys intimidation and violence against nationalist dissidents in britain
the same is true of five current labour lib dem and tory meps marked with the shame of supporting the use of british taxpayers money to support their own militia which breaks up opposition meetings and attacks their opponents with bricks darts and claw hammers
but my main point is this however well meaning and even justified criticisms of iran made here may be they will be exploited as war propaganda by the powerful vested interests that stand to gain from a military attack on that country
neocons oil companies construction corporations and the wahabi mullahs of saudi arabia all want to see the sovereign state of iran destroyed by an aggressive war
not even european liberals are naive enough to fall for lies about weapons of mass destruction again so human rights are being drafted in as a new
do not add the voice of this place to the warmongers chorus for a third illegal and counterproductive attack by the west on the muslim world
or if you must do not leave the war which hypocritical rhetoric will help to justify and unleash to the usual brave british cannon fodder eighteen year-old boys from the mersey and the thames and the tyne
instead send your own sons to come home in boxes or without their legs their arms and their sanity or mind your own business
