mr president the political message from the last council decisions addressed to speculators media and the markets is that the eu member states will do whatever it takes to safeguard the eurozone and defend the euro
whatever internal discussions take place whether the financial facility will need to double its capital and the right to buy bonds whether the financial stability mechanism after twenty thirteen will include trimming or will be ordered to sell eurobonds are ideas that are not excluded by any member state
only the timing is under discussion whether and when needed and how
let the media and analysts be under no illusion
the eu will introduce all that is needed when it is needed
regarding the financial stability mechanism the council's decision says that the mechanism is to be activated if indispensable to safeguard the stability of the eurozone as a whole
as a member from a small member state may i ask for reassurances that members like malta cyprus estonia or slovenia will be included because if they are in trouble they may not be indispensable for the stability of the whole
