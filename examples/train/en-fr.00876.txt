mr president if i may i will immediately take a different view which is that the asylum package and the five rapporteurs who have taken great care over it are worthy of support across this house
we have a shadow on the eurodac and lambert proposals and i feel that we have had excellent cooperation in building a package which is both realistic and implementable and which takes great care over transparency
for example on the eurodac issue the sensitive issue of asylum-seeker fingerprinting we have had improvements in the way fingerprint data is used and on enhancing the role and clarifying the powers of the european data protection supervisor
we would like to see key references to more articles of the charter of fundamental rights and to human dignity and children's rights and the good resolution of the issue of language and asylum seekers which has already been so well raised by antonio masip hidalgo and rosalyne lefran√ßois
on the lambert report establishing a european asylum support office we believe this is a critical step forward in making cooperation between member states relating to the common european asylum system a reality
the socialist group supports this report but we have also tabled amendments
we want to see greater transparency and accountability as i think the rapporteur is also striving to do
we want to see the appropriate involvement of the unhcr and ngos and i have added amendments which bring forward good levels of european parliament scrutiny in the system
i understand what the commissioner says about the speedy resolution and building of the european asylum support office but accountability and transparency and quality of asylum information is also very important
to work well the european asylum support office must produce the most useful transparent and objective information regularly scrutinised
with these safeguards we will have a strong addition to a fair and balanced common european asylum system
