mr president taxes are at best a necessary evil and should always reflect spending needs
a tax rate that is set before spending needs are decided is a recipe for taking people's money and then deciding what to spend it on
it is a recipe for profligacy
harmonisation of vat rates to a common standard and a common reduced rate which was the proposal of the commission back in nineteen ninety-three would take yet more power out of the hands of member states
the levying of taxation is one of the defining characteristics of a sovereign state
it will be yet another step towards the sovereign state being the european union and member states simply being powerless appendices to it
combating fraud and easing burdens on smes are red herrings
vat harmonisation is about centralisation and the consolidation of eu power
