mr president i voted against this report because of its attempts to totally unnecessarily entwine agriculture into the huge burden of regulation which it would import
i recently met with some producers in my constituency
i saw the paperwork that has been heaped upon a particular producer because he is already within the ambit of these regulations
i shudder to think what is going to happen to ordinary producers of very modest proportions when they too are subjected to this huge and totally unnecessary burden of regulation
i think it is a report that takes us very much in the wrong direction and at the very least i am happy that i was here to vote against it
