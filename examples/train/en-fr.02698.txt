mr president mrs sinclaire and i represent a region of the united kingdom whose citizens depend on the single market for their jobs and for their future
i work with small enterprises all the time and i can tell her that small enterprises in the midlands supplying the great companies in the car industry just down the road from where she and i live are working overtime at the moment because of new opportunities that we have created by giving them a framework to go and attack a market numbering five hundred million people that big an area
i do not apologise at all for the work i do here
i wish other people would be more constructive and do real work for their local citizens instead of merely coming here to complain
