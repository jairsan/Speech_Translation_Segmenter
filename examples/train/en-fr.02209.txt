there has been a lot of publicity on this particular issue all over europe
one of the things that concerns people is what this is going to mean for the future of cyber security right across the eu
i do not believe that many people are too concerned about the individual involved here
what they are concerned about is how this is going to play out across europe
i just think that it is important that the eu should have a policy on this
i would urge the commission to involve as many partners in these discussions as possible not only at member state level but also at other levels of government right across the eu so that for example cyber security is an important issue for regional and local governments as well
