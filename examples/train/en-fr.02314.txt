mr president you made some remarks at the beginning of the debate about free and fair elections and good representative government and you asked us to support the people of tunisia
no democrat could disagree
people will tolerate a lot from incompetent corrupt governments but push them too far and they will rebel
it is a doctrine of internal security services that any population is only three days away from riots and civil unrest when the food supplies run out
are there any parallels to be drawn between what is happening in tunisia and the european union
the eu gives undemocratic and incompetent government
it has a political class that is increasingly detached from the wishes of its people
there is high youth unemployment in many countries in europe as a direct result of eu policies
there are already riots and civil unrest in greece due to its purely ideological commitment to the european single currency
countries like spain portugal and ireland may soon follow greece as their economies become untenable in the straitjacket of the euro
do not think that it cannot happen in european countries
when governments become the enemies of their own people then the people will eventually rebel
i agree with what you said in your introduction but let us see those principles applied in europe as well as in other countries of the world
