mr president i completely agree with all the other speakers that this is an excellent initiative and i am very pleased that the committee on culture and education and mrs paliadeli are putting this forward
i would like particularly to thank our rapporteur who has done excellent work on this
it is a very good means of promoting europe of promoting our common culture and history
i am sure it will be a huge success and we have put in place various ways of making sure it is successful
the final sites will be chosen by a panel of experts who will have specialist knowledge in this area and as i have said before we will particularly be looking at cross-border sites to promote the idea of europe
there are also particular criteria that we ask the successful candidates to meet we want to raise the european significance of the sites chosen the successful candidates will be expected to organise education events especially for young people there will be an exchange of ideas on initiating common projects with other sites awarded the label there will be artistic and cultural activities which will foster dialogue and there will be access of course for the widest numbers of the public to visit these sites
so i think the sites when they are up and running will have a huge benefit for europe and will be something that people will be able to come to and enjoy and will promote the idea of europe and what we in parliament and the eu are doing
so i commend this report to you all
i am sure when the scheme is set up and running it will be a huge success and i have been very proud to be part of this initiative
