madam president six months after the floods in pakistan the un spoke of a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions
another three months have passed and there is still an entirely insufficient response by the eu and the wto
i voted in favour of granting pakistan emergency trade preferences for textile and other products in the eu in order for these trade preferences not simply to be a purely token measure that filled the pockets of the corrupt elites in pakistan
i call for effective control over the increased income by democratic trade unions to ensure that the money is directed towards rebuilding schools and hospitals in the areas affected by flooding
a major threat to the collective interests of all workers in pakistan has been brought to my attention by the progressive workers federation of pakistan
i oppose the disgraceful attempt and threat by the government to no longer allow trade unions to organise on a national level
