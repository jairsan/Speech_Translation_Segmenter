mr president the uk independence party opposes the euromed agreement and this is why the euromed agreement will offer significant trade concessions and even subsidies to non-member states
this is bound to be at the direct or indirect cost of the british taxpayer
moreover when the commissioner's representative spoke on euromed to the committee on international trade of which i am honoured to be a member amongst other people here he said and i quote here directly there is no question of implementing all the eu regulations
he went on to say the application of the eu regulations will be intelligent and selective
by contrast we in the uk put up with and indeed our economy suffers from all the eu regulations being applied and moreover being applied to us in a way which is both unintelligent and universal
we are not even permitted to have the kind of light bulbs that we would like
but it is not just light bulbs
after lisbon we in the uk will be ruled to a greater or lesser extent by the three amigos the president of the commission the newly appointed president of the council who must surely be tintin's grandfather and more crucially the high representative mrs cathy ashton who in her mature thirties was one of four paid officials of the far left cnd
this is a serious matter and these are the people we are stuck with but the euromed countries will not have to put up with the three amigos at all
there is also the matter of human rights
in this instance i have to ask what is going on here
syria and libya of all countries have been offered trade concessions and even subsidies to be paid for by us but where are the safeguards on human rights
nowhere to be seen for these two countries both of which have a long and frankly despicable record
as someone who was a teenager in the nineteen sixties i have to say that the proposers of this part of the resolution must have been smoking something so we are opposed to this resolution in all its parts
