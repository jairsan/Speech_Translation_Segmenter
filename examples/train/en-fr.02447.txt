madam president as the commissioner said the winds of change are blowing across north africa somewhat reminiscent of what happened in eastern europe twenty years ago
if the outcome is the same the establishment of democratic regimes then i think we should be very pleased
the downside of course is that in the short term at least we have a refugee and asylum problem particularly in italy
as italy is in the european union it is a problem for italy it is a problem for europe the solution has to be italian the solution has to be european
we cannot close the door to refugees but at the same time the door cannot be opened to all the refugees and asylum seekers in the world
so the solution really is i think in the multi-point plan suggested by my colleague mr busuttil particularly to ensure that repatriation takes place when it is proper and safe to do so and of course also to send back asylum seekers who are not deserving of that status within the european union
we have to act in solidarity with italy and we can do so
