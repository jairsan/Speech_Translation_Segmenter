mr president when dealing with european union reports never trust the label and always look at the contents of the packet
these reports appear to be about the single market trade and the transfer of jobs from higher-wage economies to lower-wage economies
however one rapporteur has not lost the opportunity to look for yet another pretext for yet further immigration not just within europe but by clear implication from outside europe
the correia de campos report refers to an influx of highly-qualified workers and seasonal workers not usually known for their surfeit of qualifications as being beneficial to the european economy
people are seen not as human beings but as mobile factors of production
bringing skilled workers from the third world robs poor countries of people they can ill afford to lose
furthermore bring third world people to europe and you bring part of the third world with them
you cannot turn them into new europeans by the application of a little cultural stardust
people are not the product of distinctive cultures distinctive cultures are the product of distinctive peoples
