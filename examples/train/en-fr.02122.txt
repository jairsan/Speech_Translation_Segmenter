mr president i support the line taken by mr gallagher in his report and will be voting accordingly tomorrow when we get to that
the principle of multiannual planning is a sensible one if it allows for reasonable forward planning on the part of fishers and also the processing sector
but in general there remain some very negative aspects of eu fisheries management as you are aware
i strongly believe that it is the fishing nations themselves those who have entitlement in particular sea areas who should be making the decisions on stock conservation and management
a number of speakers have again referred to the scandal of discards
there is a growing awareness in scotland that discards are a direct result of eu regulation and in particular the cod recovery plan
i hope the commissioner will take note of this and take action to deal with that part of the discard scandal which could be avoided by changing some of the unworkable regulations which currently apply
