madam president i know the european city guide best and in spite of attempts to close it down this menace continues
in the uk in may two thousand and eight the misleading marketing regulations came into force
they outlaw using the small print of any document to hide the true cost of a service
so the office of fair trading can now take action against uk companies but there is a serious drawback
the oft does not have jurisdiction to tackle any scams from elsewhere including from other member states so the problem continues and i continue to receive my share of complaints
more to the point while they may operate elsewhere due to lax policing why can my own government not prevent what comes from mainland europe
the answer to that lies at the heart of this useless eu which has demolished national frontiers
the free movement of people goods and services provides perfect cover for the people traffickers the terrorists and for threatening traumatising scams aimed at fleecing the unwary
