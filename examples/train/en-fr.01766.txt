mr president i very much welcome this report and the new european rules for organ donation
if you die in another european union country why should your organ not be used to save life
if you need a rare match from another european country surely these rules are sensible to implement
although it has not been part of the debate i would also like to put on record my personal support for an opt-out rather than an opt-in system for organ donation
eighty per cent of european citizens say they support organ donation yet only twelve per cent hold organ donation cards
we have to close the gap
last year twenty-five people in my east of england regional constituency died because they were on the organ donor waiting list but no donor could be found in time
at addenbrooke's and papworth hospitals in my constituency we have european and worldwide expertise in lung and heart transplants
let our surgeons do their work
let our patients be treated
this is the gift of life
