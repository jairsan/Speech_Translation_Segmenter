madam president as part of our debate today on human rights in eu internal and external policies i would like to make a special point on the situation of women in conflict zones and in particular in congo gaza and iran where this question should no longer be overlooked
women as well as children are the ones suffering most from the devastating consequences of conflict situations
we should not allow breaches of human rights affecting women to be a side issue the eu should prioritise the defence of women's rights in its foreign affairs and humanitarian policies
human rights considerations and in particular the status of women in a large number of third countries are too often sacrificed for the sake of the economic interests of some eu member states
we need and we demand today appropriate and concrete steps to make the eu's principles in its action within and outside the union a real tool of human rights promotion with a specific focus on women's rights
