mr president my group supports this report because it is a move in the right direction calling for an eu strategy and a road map for roma inclusion
the report is inspired by a keen perception of the extremely heterogeneous cultural aspects between different roma communities in europe
at the same time it advocates the introduction of binding and minimum standards at eu level for starting a real policy of integration
the eu strategy addresses all forms of violation of the fundamental rights of the roma people and calls for effective access for the roma to the labour market by making micro-credit available for self-employment and entrepreneurship
my group particularly appreciates the stress on the education of roma children namely the abolition of classroom segregation through the employment of roma mediators and an increase in the number of roma teachers
