mr president as a farmer i have always wanted to see animals properly treated and it is my belief that in the uk they are at least by our scientific community
i have visited huntingdon life sciences in my constituency and i know that dedicated people are doing only what is necessary for scientific progress
this institution carries out essential tests on drugs that in a few years time may protect the life of somebody in this chamber
every employee there has an obligation to be a whistleblower if they have evidence of the maltreatment of animals
we cannot and must not impose unnecessary controls which arbitrarily restrict certain approaches
these three amendments will not enhance animal welfare but their imposition will impede research
they are inter alia a recipe for legalistic conflict which does nothing to advance medicine but may line lawyers pockets
frankly the eu needs to apply rather more the concept of if it isn t broken don t fix it
in the uk we have a sensible regime a responsible scientific community including in my own constituency that powerhouse of global scientific progress cambridge university and balanced laws which sensibly address the needs of both science and animal welfare
that careful balance needs to be preserved
my message to the eu on this is straightforward just for once leave well alone
