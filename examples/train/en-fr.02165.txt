madam president i wanted to ask mr michel given his distinguished career as a development commissioner and his enormous experience in africa whether he could get african parliaments particularly the african parliaments public scrutiny committees on finances and budgets to be empowered and strengthened and given greater support from us so that they could actually question what happens with their ministers and their presidents in the enactment and clarity and accountability of the legislative and spending process
would he agree that this may be something very important that we can do practically
