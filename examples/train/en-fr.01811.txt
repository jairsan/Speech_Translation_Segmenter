the task force was created in the specific context of support for greece and as you know the commission is participating in the task force in a fully constructive and loyal way
in fact the task force was established by the president of the european council in cooperation with the commission
the commission is participating in the task force and i am happy with the way that work is progressing in the task force
there is a consensus emerging on steps towards economic coordination in europe and most of those steps are completely in line with the proposals made by our communication of twelve may
so may i say that this task force is performing an important task because they have addressed important points like the implementation of the stability and growth pact and the european semester
i am looking forward to the report of the president of the european council to the european council on thursday
the commission will of course not abdicate from its right of initiative and will present further proposals building also on the consensus emerging in that task force
