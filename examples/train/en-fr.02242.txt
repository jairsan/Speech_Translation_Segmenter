mr president i believe that the citizens initiative could be useful because it will allow citizens to speak directly to the commission but the question remains as to how the commission will react to proposals it does not like
i think we can expect a whole host of initiatives asking the commission to do more asking for there to be more europe and no doubt the commission will respond enthusiastically to that request
how will it react however to proposals for less europe or perhaps for europe to do things better or to waste less money or perhaps a declaration that there would never be any european taxation
i wait to see with interest how the commission reacts to those proposals
will it treat those proposals with respect
if it only responds to the proposals it likes then this initiative will be redundant
