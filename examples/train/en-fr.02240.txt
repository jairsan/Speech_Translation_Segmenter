mr president like my colleague mr fox i too share the concern as many british conservatives did
at a time of austerity when governments across the european union and in fact governments across the world are looking to tighten their belt and to rein in spending how dare we ask for an increase in taxpayers money
surely it is a time to tighten our belts and to set an example
we should not have been asking for an increase we should not even have been asking for a freeze we should have been asking for a cut in the eu budget so that taxpayers across the european union can take their politicians seriously and know that we understand the pain that they are feeling at this time and that we share the pain with them rather than looking like an elected elite who pay no attention to the people who put us there
