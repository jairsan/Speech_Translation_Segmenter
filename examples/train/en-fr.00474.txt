madam president a mystique bordering on a religious creed has grown up around this alleged global warming
the environmental scientist has had a field day but the natural world obeys the laws of physics and chemistry subjects which i taught for thirty-nine years
the global warming theory has cast co a natural constituent of the atmosphere as a demon gas
it does have the effect slightly of trapping heat around the world but how
you need to draw a graph showing how co perhaps causes warming
is it an arithmetic graph i must become technical where equal rises in co cause equal rises in warming
is it an exponential graph a runaway where co in extra amounts causes an ever-increasing rise in global warming
or is it a logarithmic graph where extra amounts of co cause less and less extra warming eventually becoming a flat line
i suspected it to be the last and the hadley centre the uk's leading authority on this subject confirmed that it is the last graph
we are nearly on the flat line if not already there
extra co will have no more effect
there is no problem
