mr president the overwhelming irish yes was not due only to a better understanding of the lisbon treaty but also to the understanding of the fact that true respect must be mutual and compassionate
our irish fellow citizens also realised that the european train does not wait indefinitely for those who miss their appointment with history
the czech case is a different one
the czech people signalled in an appropriate way its support for a more political and social more efficient and more democratic europe
the government also supported the ratification of the treaty and parliament ratified the treaty
it is therefore not for us to show respect for the czech people but for the president of the czech republic to show respect for his people and its parliament
for us it is important to draw the right line between what is right and what is abuse and to proceed in such a way as to show and to prove that for us the right ends where and when the abuse starts
we cannot accept being prisoners of filibusters
we should acknowledge that the lisbon treaty was duly ratified by all member states and start the establishment of the institutions on that basis
parliament should be fully involved in this process
