mr president the achievement of mrs hedh and mrs bauer today although speaking at a very late hour as mrs hedh said is to come here tonight and hear the outgoing commissioner mr barrot and the new spanish presidency use words like determined and ambitious for the commissioner
it is worth waiting until this late hour to hear it because there are many people in this chamber today including the authors who understand the complexity of this brutal modern day phenomenon but also understand that the eu is expected by its citizens to tackle this modern day scourge
mr barrot talked about the need for new legislation
we hope we will see the commission proposal very soon
this morning at the hearing of commissioner-designate mrs malmström we also saw a positive response to our proposal for an eu anti-trafficking coordinator
if you start to put together the various pieces of this puzzle at least we are moving forward but the sheer scale of the problem described by anna hedh means that we really have to turn words into action
with trafficking being such a complex phenomenon touching on so many different areas such as forced labour organised crime sexual exploitation and child abuse our response must be multi-pronged and holistic
mr barrot listed many of the things that we would like to see as a reality and if they come together in a package across the eu we will have a determined policy which eu citizens will see as a plan of action
at the moment eu citizens understand the scourge of trafficking but they do not see the holistic approach and they do not understand what the eu is doing as a whole
i am happy that commissioner-designate malmström underlined her commitment today to come forward with a new legislative proposal very soon and i am also happy to see the spanish presidency underlining not just the fight against trafficking but related issues such as violence against women
it is important that these all come together to show real determination and heart in this proposal
although the hour is late we now need the words to be turned into action and the authors have done a good job for us today
