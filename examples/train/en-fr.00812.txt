madam president i just wondered if it was actually in order for mr kamall to urge the european parliament to ignore the treaties and ignore its legal obligations and indeed to increase the powers of the european parliament in addressing the issue of the buildings in three different locations
he knows perfectly well that unfortunately it is the governments of the member states who decide on the seats of the institutions and unfortunately under the chairmanship of the former leader of his party john major at the edinburgh summit in nineteen ninety-two they imposed a legal obligation on the european parliament to have twelve part-sessions a year in strasbourg
that is unfortunate but surely the answer is not to break the law
surely the answer is to ask the governments to revise that unfortunate decision that was taken under the leadership of the former leader of his party
