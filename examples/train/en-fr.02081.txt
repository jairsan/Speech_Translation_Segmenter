mr president we have been promised economic growth but the competition that european countries face from the developing economies will lead to the destruction of the manufacturing bases and jobs of our countries
we can only compete with them by driving down the living standards of our workers
we must reject globalism protect our economies and stop building up the strength of our competitors
we have been promised improved economic governance in europe
however the economies of member states are very different and a single economic prescription will not suit twenty-seven different countries
each country must prescribe the form of governance that it needs
the economic crisis started with the activities of the banks but the response of governments has been to rush to their rescue
we need to control the credit-creating activities i
the money-making activities of the banks
the banks must serve our economies and not be allowed to follow their own agenda and they must certainly not be our favoured beneficiaries
