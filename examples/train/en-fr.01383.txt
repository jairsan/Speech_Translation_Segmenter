mr president i would like to thank the rapporteurs and other shadows for the hard work they have put into producing these reports
taxation particularly any form of harmonisation is always a sensitive issue
we need to balance the need to operate an efficient single market with the need to protect member state competence on taxation
i would advise mr lamberts that the best way to minimise tax evasion is to have simpler taxes and lower tax rates
tax competition is a jolly good thing
it protects the taxpayer from rapacious governments
member states must be free to sign bilateral agreements with third countries
the uk and the us readily share information because of their history of cooperation in fighting terrorism
if this information was to be shared across the eu many third countries would refuse to sign similar agreements in the future
cooperation would cease and national security would be put at risk
i urge members to approach these reports pragmatically
we need to ensure that we do not indulge in needless harmonisation which endangers national security
