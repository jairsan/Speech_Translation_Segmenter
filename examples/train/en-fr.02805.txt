mr president on twenty-five april twenty eleven the united nations made public the advisory report of the panel of experts appointed by the un secretary-general on accountability in relation to the armed conflict in sri lanka
the panel found credible allegations which if proven would indicate that serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law were committed by the sri lankan military and the ltte some of which would amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity
the panel also makes a series of recommendations to the un secretary-general and to the government of sri lanka which in the panel's words will serve as the framework for an ongoing and constructive engagement between the secretary-general and the government of sri lanka on accountability
recommendations include the launch of genuine investigations by the government of sri lanka and the establishment of an independent international mechanism by the un secretary-general
the un has stated that the un secretary-general is carefully reviewing the reports conclusions and recommendations and the un high commissioner for human rights has urged the sri lankan government to quickly carry out the measures suggested by the panel and ensure justice
the government of sri lanka on its side has rejected the report in the strongest terms
earlier this week high representative catherine ashton issued a declaration on behalf of the eu reiterating the eu view that an independent process to address these extremely serious allegations should contribute to strengthening the process of reconciliation and ensuring lasting peace and security in sri lanka
the high representative has stressed that the issue of accountability should be seen as an essential part of the process of national reconciliation
the eu therefore hopes that the government of sri lanka will recognise the constructive objectives of the report and encourages it to engage with the un secretary-general on its contents
