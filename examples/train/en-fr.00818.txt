mr president this debate once again demonstrates the limitations of urgencies with huge numbers of representations because there has been insufficient time for proper negotiation and consultation
i want to put on record that the original socialist text clearly opposes any question of forced deportation and calls for full compliance with the geneva convention and full access by international human rights organisations
to mr vidal-quadras and others having myself sought to get a compromise by getting cross-party support only for amendments two three and six and then the socialist support for the joint resolution it is a complete distortion to say that these amendments could be used as a pretext to massacre residents
whether people support or criticise the pmoi in a human rights debate no one in this chamber should disagree with amendments which seek to support human rights obligations on any or all parties anywhere in the world
