madam president i would like to raise an issue which is closely linked to aviation safety and which underlines the need to make the operation of the eu blacklist as effective as possible
in december two thousand and eight the council finally adopted the eu code of conduct on arms transfers
this code controls the export from the eu of military technology and equipment
however a concern persists that not all eu arms-exporting countries are abiding by the code and that european arms are still being supplied to conflict zones
but one measure has been shown to be very effective in curtailing the illegal supply of arms and that is the eu aviation blacklist
a swedish study in two thousand and eight showed that the air cargo operators who are involved in arms transfers to conflict zones are the same operators who habitually violate air safety standards
maybe it is not surprising that dodgy operators with a lax approach to safety should also be revealed as dodgy operators as far as the cargoes they carry are concerned
but the happy consequence of this link is that the measures to ensure strict control of aircraft measures which are designed to protect european citizens are also helping to protect the citizens of other continents especially africa from the destruction that takes place when conflicts are fuelled by abundantly available small arms and light weaponry
so i would ask commissioner piebalgs as development commissioner if he could add his personal weight to the commission's efforts to ensure that the blacklists are implemented effectively and systematically
