madam president the climate change conference in copenhagen in december presents us with a unique opportunity to address this massive and huge problem
if we consider the consequences of global warming it is obvious that the developing world is paying the price for environmental damage caused by the richer nations
climate change is not the only environmental problem we face but it is imperative that we attempt to address it in copenhagen
it is the opportunity for the eu to speak with one voice and find solutions to a problem which is affecting us all
all countries must play their part in terms of achieving targets and sustainable development
the developing world must be supported and encouraged but the targets set for these nations must be realistic
i know that there are others who hold a different view from the one that i hold but i do not believe that we can afford to wait fifty sixty or seventy years to find out who was right or who was wrong
we have a responsibility today to act now to do what we can while we are here
