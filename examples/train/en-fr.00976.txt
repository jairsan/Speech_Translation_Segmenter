madam president tajikistan is not blessed with the energy and mineral resources of other countries in central asia
however that is no excuse for marginalising tajikistan at the expense of its wealthier and larger neighbours
central asia is a region vital to the eu's political and energy security
in terms of strengthening relations with the eu some countries in the region will progress faster than others
that is inevitable
but we must retain a sense of collective engagement as we continue to improve ties with what was until quite recently a diplomatically isolated and largely overlooked region particularly by the european union
favouring some countries in central asia over others risks creating a discord and division in the region
in particular islamist terrorists in the region have shown a determination to exploit poverty and inadequate governance to radicalise the people and spread their message of hatred
the government of tajikistan has rejected extremism and with the help of the international community is seeking now to consolidate its nation's democracy
tajikistan still bears the scars of a brutal civil war between secular and jihadi forces that erupted after the collapse of the soviet union in the early nineteen nineties
people in tajikistan have no wish to see the return of bloodshed which is why they have given courageous support to nato operations against the taliban in afghanistan
the isaf mission in afghanistan is vital to tajikistan's long-term future and its desire to find a security anchor westwards
it is fair to say that tajikistan's record in democratisation and human rights is imperfect but i am convinced that dialogue and engagement on the eu's part will encourage tajikistan towards positive change
certainly that seems to be the european union's view with regard to belarus and uzbekistan so tajikistan deserves to be treated in the same way
the ecr group therefore supports a deeper strategic political and economic partnership with tajikistan based on a commitment of progress towards openness democracy and higher standards of human rights
