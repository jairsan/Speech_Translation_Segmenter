madam president you did indeed deal with it very speedily but i do think that it is not acceptable that a member should rise in his place and make such a serious allegation against other members of the house
i hold no support for the gentlemen of the extreme right but the president of parliament must uphold and protect the rights of members
we are being accused of all sorts of outrageous things and we are entitled to proper conduct and ethical behaviour by our colleagues here in this house and indeed outside the house
