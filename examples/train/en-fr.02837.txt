madam president i wish to express my deep concern regarding the medics who have been arrested in bahrain
many of these medics have been accused of trying to overthrow the monarchy and face trial with military prosecutors and possible death sentences
yet these doctors and nurses had simply treated injured protestors who were brought to their hospitals
amnesty international and have also expressed extreme concern over the safety of those involved and indeed the motivation behind their arrests
i fully support the irish nurses and midwives organisation and the international council of nurses and indeed a number of irish doctors who are adding their voices in condemnation of these awful events
in the last few days i have received information from a number of sources which points to torture and inhumane treatment some medics have been severely beaten and have been denied access to their families and legal advisers
this kind of action is totally unacceptable
i am calling publicly on our high representative catherine ashton
i have already written to her to ask her to make every effort to intervene on behalf of those medics who simply did what medical personnel do try to save lives
