mr president i strongly support the rapporteur in her report and salute her sterling work on behalf of citizens right across europe who have fallen foul of the outrageous property practices in spain
the right to own and enjoy private property is a fundamental right recognised by the european convention
yet several constituents of mine who put their life savings into a home in spain now find themselves ambushed and devastated by laws and claims which would deprive them of their property or cost them enormous sums of money in order to retain it
it appears that civic authorities in spain in cahoots with grasping unscrupulous developers have been a terror to those who thought they were buying legitimate homes and properties and if this report helps address that then it can only do good
