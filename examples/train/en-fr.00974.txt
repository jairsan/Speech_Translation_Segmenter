mr president like my previous colleague who spoke earlier i would like to say that i also have my reservations about mr barroso being re-elected as president of the commission
after all he more than anyone is committed to further european integration often against the will of the peoples of europe
but he did come to our group meeting the ecr group meeting and explain that he was in favour of smart regulation
now of course there is much doubt about what smart regulation means
many people believe that smart regulation is bad regulation or that any regulation is not very smart regulation
but i would ask him if he really is in favour of smart regulation to make sure that on every directive the commission carries out a proper economic impact assessment
we have going through this house next year the alternative investment fund management directive
the commission has failed so far to conduct any proper economic impact assessment in fact they say it cannot be done
how under those circumstances are we going to get smart regulation
i ask mr barroso to reconsider
