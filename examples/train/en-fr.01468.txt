mr president honourable members of the european parliament the session went a little bit over time and the president of the commission had to leave because of other obligations but it is an honour for me to answer on behalf of president barroso and on behalf of the commission
i would like to start by thanking you all for a fascinating debate for many interesting ideas and for the enthusiasm and support you are showing for the eu twenty twenty strategy
without your support the eu twenty twenty cannot and will not succeed
i can assure you that the commission will be very bold the eu twenty twenty will put citizens employment and reduction of poverty at its core and centre
i can also assure you that we have learned the lessons of the lisbon strategy and therefore we will focus on a lesser number of targets and we will definitely improve on governance
at the commission we are very much encouraged by the strong interest and what we hope will be strong support from the european parliament
we are also very much encouraged by the sense of urgency in the european council where it is very clear that the atmosphere today is very different from that of five years ago when we were discussing the parameters of the lisbon strategy
but we need to do more we need to get local and regional support for this strategy and most importantly we need to get the people behind it
we must make sure that they will not see it as another administrative exercise but that they will see it as an approach on how to improve life in europe and in their countries and regions
i would like to ask you honourable members to help us with this task
let us not compete among the institutions let us cooperate let us focus on the priorities and let us deliver the concrete results
in the eu twenty twenty strategy we would like to introduce a three-interlocking-pillar system based on a smart greener and inclusive economy and we would like to build upon these pillars flexible initiatives which would be aimed at the bottlenecks at the problems which are slowing the european economy which are blocking it from using its full potential
we would like to focus more on education and training so that the labour force in europe will maintain the competitive edge which europe deserves
we will keep the eu twenty twenty strategy linked to the stability and growth pact because a solid fiscal position is key to the economic stability
we talked much today about greece and i would like to assure you that there was consensus that the euro area member states would take determined and coordinated action if needed to safeguard financial stability in the euro area
the commission will closely work together with greece and monitor how it implements the recommendations
a mission led by the commission with the ecb and drawing on the imf for technical support is now in athens to assess the need for greece to take additional measures
let me be very clear we have the tools to safeguard financial stability in the euro area if needed this involves in particular the euro area members the commission and the european central bank and we stand ready to put in place a european framework for coordinating the action
but each stage in this process must be allowed to take its course and it is now for greece to press on with the reforms and to put the necessary measures in place
i believe that we are ready to take bold action be it on the eu twenty twenty strategy or on the situation in greece
