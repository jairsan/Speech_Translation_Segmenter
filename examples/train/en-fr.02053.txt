madam president i find this debate rather risible almost laughable
i have heard several speeches now and we have been talking about eradicating poverty without once mentioning how we create more wealth
you cannot eradicate poverty without creating wealth otherwise what you are doing is just distributing from one to another not creating new wealth
in the international domain eur eight hundred and eighty billion come out of the developing countries through all sorts of corruption and other activities which are not recorded or taxable or deposited in proper banks
this is a scandal of the financial community in international development
those eur eight hundred and eighty billion should be creating wealth in the developing countries
in europe poverty is on the increase because we are over-regulating ourselves against creating wealth when challenges are now coming from india and china
we need to revisit this
