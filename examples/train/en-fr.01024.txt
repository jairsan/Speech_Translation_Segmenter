mr president the result of the referendum in ireland at the weekend on the lisbon treaty is living proof that this parliament is not democratic honest or accountable
but who in here really cares
well i do
the fact that the irish were made to vote twice proves that the eu has now become a dictatorship
if the vote does not go the way of the eu dictators then they simply vote again and again until the right result is achieved
this is not fair and is in my view morally wrong
the lisbon fanatics in this parliament will now go full steam ahead to create a new european superstate of five hundred million people
the injustice is that people in my country the united kingdom were promised a referendum but denied one
the irony is that under the lisbon treaty there will be a full-time president
it is quite likely to be tony blair
the new president of the eu will be the head of state
you cannot have two heads of state and since the eu takes precedence over national bodies the eu president perhaps tony blair will take precedence over our queen
the people of my country will not accept an unelected failure or anybody else taking precedence over our queen
god save our queen
