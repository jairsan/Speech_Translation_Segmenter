mr president just a point of order i know other colleagues will share my concern about catch the eye and you are all-powerful in this regard but members who are on the agricultural committee who have actually worked on this dossier for a long time and who were at this debate at its very inception in my view deserve to have their considered opinions heard and i could not catch your eye because you would not look at me although i caught six other eyes around you mr president
could i ask while i have the floor the commission to comment on the possibility of less-favoured areas moving to pillar one
i will put in a written statement on this issue
i hope you support my point colleagues
