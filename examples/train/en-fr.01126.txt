madam president obviously coordinating research in this area is really important and this is not just about alzheimer's disease as the term neurodegenerative covers a multitude of diseases
parliament actually has a very significant role to play in how that research will be done
i draw attention to the ongoing discussions between parliament and the council on the issue of the welfare of animals used in scientific experimentation
i am concerned and hopeful because of our rapporteur and the direction of the talks that we continue to allow necessary research using animals in a way that is more welfare friendly than perhaps it is now
this is because we need research in this area in order to do the things that have been spoken about to prevent and to treat people and we may be amongst them ourselves in time who unfortunately may be affected by these diseases
i hope we can have an early agreement at second reading on this very important directive
while we may not have had a great input into this particular issue we will have had one into the ongoing research
