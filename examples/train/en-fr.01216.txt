madam president i would welcome much of what mr bufton was saying but i would take issue and question him on one of his phrases there
he said that unregulated meat was imported into the eu
you said that mr bufton quite early in your presentation
given the fifteen minute presentation we heard from the commissioner earlier on would you accept that that is just clearly not the case that your sort of hyperbole undermines the case in the serious discussion we are having here tonight about a very technical piece of legislation and regulation and that you are not actually helping the case you are hindering it
