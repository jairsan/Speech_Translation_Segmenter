madam president the two point three increase in the budget requested by this parliament calls into question its sense of responsibility
going through the different expenditure lines you can find many growing fifty to one hundred without any reasonable justification
at the beginning of this plenary session i asked this parliament to postpone the vote on the fernandes report owing to lack of accurate information on costs for the house of european history and a conflict of interest but my request was voted down
a sum of eur two point five million has already been paid out without enough information
it appears that meps are willing to operate in the dark and just hand over taxpayers money without asking the right questions
i can only ask the british prime minister to accept nothing but a significant reduction of the whole eu budget for twenty twelve and hope that parliament will be the one to bear the biggest cut
