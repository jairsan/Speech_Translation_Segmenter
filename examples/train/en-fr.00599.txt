mr president my speech looks at the relationship between the eastern partnership and the black sea synergy
in my opinion the main obstacle is finding the synergy's proper place in this increasingly complex picture of eu initiatives towards the east
consequently the real substantive issues of the black sea area like energy and frozen conflicts are approached either through the eu neighbourhood policy where the money is the future eastern partnership designed to increase the security confidence of the countries involved and secure the energy deliveries to the eu after the georgian war the eu's strategic relationship with russia and ukraine or the accession talks with turkey
what then is left for the black sea synergy to achieve
not much i should say apart from seminars and studies on how to extend the existing european initiatives towards the area and non-political issues
it is therefore necessary to improve the substance too of the framework known as synergy if one wants to maintain its credibility
