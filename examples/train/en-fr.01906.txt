madam president as europeans we are particularly moved by the human rights situation in iran not only because we consider the eu to be a community of values and believe in a world without the death penalty but also because today we are all too aware of the individuals behind the numbers
at least three hundred and eighty-eight people were executed in iran in two thousand and nine alone
these individual deaths are meant to deter a generation in their calls for freedom but in fact they inspire a multitude more
in recent weeks a lively discussion about human rights in iran erupted in the netherlands when a dutch-iranian citizen was imprisoned
the iranian government does not recognise the dutch citizenship of dual nationals
therefore dutch diplomats have not been able to speak with this person and neither have her lawyers
the dutch government engages with citizens in prisons all over the world regardless of their cases
it is a constitutional obligation to provide for the well-being of its citizens
this issue matters to all member states and should be addressed eu-wide in relation to iran giving human rights a more prominent position on our agenda
today we are talking about people women and individuals whose lives are effectively over even if they are still alive
zahra and sakineh are no exception to the thousands of prisoners in iran who are less known and who may feel as though their voices are not heard
the iranian government should realise that tough language military technology or resilience in times of sanctions will not end the country's self-isolation or move it forward
rather the legitimacy derived from providing for the well-being of citizens earns respect and credibility in the international community
justice and security are actually two sides of the same coin
there cannot be impunity for people who hang children who systematically censor and rape and who stone women
when addressing iran let us revive the human rights dialogue so that the eu sends a strong signal besides that of the euro and of sanctions and engages iran on its most sensitive and our most fundamental point human rights and fundamental freedoms and attaches consequences to their abuse
