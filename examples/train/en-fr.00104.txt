madam president in the recent debate on the lisbon treaty in ireland the issues thrown up by the laval and viking cases were centre-stage in many of the debates and contributed to real uncertainty and unease
i have heard many of my colleagues here this morning re-echo these sentiments and that is why i am pleased with the efforts of parliament here this morning
i am also reassured by the words of the commissioner when he says that the commission agrees with parliament that the posting of workers directive needs to be improved and properly transposed
the view of parliament is quite clear
in paragraph thirty-three it reaffirms that fundamental social rights are not subordinate to economic rights in a hierarchy of fundamental freedoms and later in the report it emphasises that the freedom to provide services does not contradict and is not in any way superior to the fundamental right to strike
these statements are crystal clear and indicate where parliament stands and we now look to the commission to take the baton and run with it
i started with lisbon and i will finish with it ratification of the charter of fundamental rights and the inclusion of the social clause in the lisbon treaty would have improved the situation of workers across the eu
