madam president i did in the end vote for this report because as a whole we are all in favour of preserving our environment
that is a noble tradition of my party the conservative party in britain but i think i have to put two riders to it
the first rider is that we can only have a proper policy on climate change if everybody joins in
it is simply a waste of time for the european union or an individual country to have a policy
so we have to involve the countries of asia
the second rider is that in the uncertain times in which we live a policy of climate change has to be tempered with the need for energy security
we face a situation in the world today where all of our countries need a ready supply of energy
that must be predominant because without it the economies and the welfare and the well-being of our people will not be sustained
