mr president i would just like to make a few comments regarding what was said this morning by both president van rompuy and president barroso
it would appear that they are both in denial denial of the fact that the eurozone is in crisis and we are now on the brink of collapse
there are many people over there also in denial
for goodness sake wake up
people are watching this from their homelands and they realise that there are not many people in this chamber anyway
this is the biggest crisis that you have ever had and i am telling you now that this is serious
i will ask mr barroso and mr van rompuy to tell me please you are speaking in a couple of minutes what is your plan b there must be a plan b or are you just going to let this go until it goes into ruin
i believe this is the biggest crisis that we have had
member states have been affected across the spectrum
you owe it to the people to have a plan b please tell us if you have got one
