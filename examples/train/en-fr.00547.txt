mr president if there are any weaknesses in the nitrates and water framework directives i think issues in relation to pig poultry and dairy activities must be addressed there
i do think the compliance costs would outweigh the benefits of their inclusion in this particular piece of legislation
but there are other legislative vehicles for tackling these particular sectors and they must be looked at on that basis
on the issue of large combustion plants the eu ets operation today does not safeguard against design lock-in of unnecessary pollution in many new high-cost and high-emitting installations particularly in new coal-fired plants which when built would expect to operate for over forty years thus making it difficult and more expensive to meet overall climate goals
co emission performance standards would help ensure the electricity sector is decarbonised to a timetable consistent both with limiting increases in global average temperatures to less than two c and with bringing new cleaner technologies on-stream
industry needs above all legislative certainty to make investment decisions on these large expensive capital projects
a three hundred and fifty g limit would ensure that only the most efficient state of the art gas-fired plants for example are built
co standards that apply from say twenty twenty would mean that new coal-fired plant stations could only be built after entry into force of this proposal providing they use co capture equipment from twenty twenty onwards by when we expect ccs to be commercially available
existing installations would have a longer period to comply with the standard either by adding co capture technology or indeed by closing down
installations could also comply with the standard in other ways for example by co-firing biomass or by using the heat from cogen techniques
as rapporteur on the recent eu ets review i am concerned with the overall level of ambition across all our policies
the latest science shows us that we need to have stricter emission limits over a shorter timetable if we are to achieve the two c target which by our vote on the climate and energy package in december we as a parliament accept as necessary for the environmental social and economic future of society
the ets alone will not be enough to cut electricity sector emissions on the scale required
to conclude there is comfort in an esn but i am still worried that this may be an incentive to the lowest possible common denominator and minimal emission reductions in other words a race to the bottom
please convince me otherwise
