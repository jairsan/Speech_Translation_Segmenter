madam president i speak on behalf of the s d group but most members will recognise the need for extra resources after the lisbon treaty
however there are a number of questions on the timing and the funding of these proposals
colleagues have raised some of those issues
there are also other questions
for example if we are to have extra staff resources on what evidence is this based
were figures just plucked from the air
or if it was based on evidence i think we should have been given that evidence
also how will the extra staff for the secretariat be allocated
i think we should have been given that information as well
i also think that if we accept the extra assistance allowance of eur one five hundred per month we should also look at other costs costs for extra office space which may be required
in fact we should be given the global costs for that
this is going to be a difficult decision for members tomorrow
it is always controversial when you are asked to give yourselves resources
if we had been given all the information i and my colleagues have been asking for the decision tomorrow might have been easier for members to take
