mr president much attention is currently being focused on the technology side of mitigating the effects of climate change through the development of alternative fuels
i express my congratulations on this effort and would like to contribute to this debate
i would like to call attention to algae oil which can be converted to a fuel as a replacement for fossil fuel oil
it can be considered a win-win type of fuel because it absorbs co throughout its production therefore making it a carbon positive source of energy
what is more contrary to increasingly controversial biofuels it does not displace food production
indeed it can be grown in natural ponds or artificial structures
it is also win-win because it is particularly suitable for production in coastal communities where the trouble in the fishing industry is making it necessary for us to find new industries
given these facts i urge the commission to take algae oil very seriously
it also has the advantage of being a high-energy low-weight fuel and one of the few that promises to be able to replace rocket fuel and air fuels
