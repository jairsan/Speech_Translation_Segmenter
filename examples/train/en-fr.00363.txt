mr president the uk independence party is opposed to racism female genital mutilation the criminalisation of homosexuality and prejudice against foreigners wherever in the world that may occur
however the british enjoy perfectly good human rights under our own law and we do not need the protection of the european union
the eu is undemocratic and anti-democratic and it is not therefore a suitable guardian of anybody's human rights
we would also like to remind parliament that family law is a member state competence and is not an area of eu jurisdiction
the issue of whether drug abusers should face criminal charges is a matter for member state law and the eu should not seek to undermine and replace the judicial systems of member states
therefore the uk independence party meps voted against this report
