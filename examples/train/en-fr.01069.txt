madam president the issue of food security needs to be mentioned in this debate on climate change for the developing world in particular
it is very difficult to ask people to look at climate change mitigation if their basic needs for food are not met
we need to allow them to use the best available technology to produce in a sustainable way food which does not harm the environment and to tackle the issue of climate change
i have a concern in relation to the world trade organisation and a deal on agriculture which does not take into account the impact for example of deforestation in brazil as it supplies beef to the european union
these are very complex issues
we might solve a problem in one place and create another elsewhere
we obviously need a global agreement which tackles climate change but we also need to recognise the very serious issue of food security
