mr president whilst good libyan people are being bombed and terrorised by mr gaddafi the eu has been shelling out on projects for libya like enhancing respect for international humanitarian law
it is pretty obvious that has not worked
meanwhile baroness ashton here is demanding yet more resources on top of the almost eur three billion the external action service is due to receive
instead of being immersed further in this bloated duplicating and insatiable eu foreign service and european defence agency britain should spend the gbp forty-eight million a day we pay for eu membership on our own national defence interests
the libyan crisis has shown the value of having aircraft carriers with fast jets stationed off crisis zones
i appeal to david cameron to see sense and reprieve both the carrier hms ark royal and at least a minimum number of harriers
during the falklands crisis mrs thatcher successfully reprieved the ark's sister ship hms invincible
we must do the same for the ark royal
