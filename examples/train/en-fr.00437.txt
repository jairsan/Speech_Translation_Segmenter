madam president i welcome this debate and in line with the accompanying motion for a resolution i encourage all eu member states to sign and ratify the council of europe convention on the protection of children against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse
i also urge all eu member states to sign up to the optional protocol to the un convention on the rights of the child on the sale of children child prostitution and child pornography
the council of europe convention is the first international legal instrument to categorise the various forms of sexual abuse of children as criminal offences including such abuse perpetrated with the use of force coercion or threats even within the family
however seven eu member states have still not signed this convention and eight member states have still to ratify the un optional protocol
the internet is increasingly being used by potential and actual sex offenders as a medium for the sexual abuse of children in particular through grooming and child pornography
while i accept that irish criminal law protecting children against sexual abuse and exploitation is quite comprehensive i would nevertheless urge the irish government to bring forward up-to-date legislation as soon as possible to deal with the proliferation of new ways by which children can be subject to sexual abuse
