mr president my first comment is that the european globalisation adjustment fund is a real expression of solidarity between eu citizens and states
secondly as an irish member i am indeed very pleased that the workers in dell who have been made redundant at least now have an opportunity to look forward and to plan for the future
however as alan kelly has said it is very important to ensure that any programmes or training courses that are put in place are tailor-made to respond to the needs of workers and that the possibility of re-entering the labour market or setting up one's own business is the clear objective of any assistance
finally i want to acknowledge the role of parliament in approving the fund for dell workers
despite some of the very serious issues that have been raised here this evening we did not hold the workers hostage and we approved the eur fourteen point eight million application
however the commission must ensure that there is coherence in eu industrial policy and that the eu budget is not used to increase shareholder value in some companies while eu workers pay a price
