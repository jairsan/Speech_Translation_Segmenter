mr president we all know that gambling is a very emotive subject
you only have to listen to the speeches that have been made before me
there are those who believe that gambling is the work of the devil and that those who take part deserve to be cast into hellfire and deserve all the losses they have on this earth and in the afterlife
now that is an extreme view granted but if you were to look at some of the language used in this report the issues of a transparent sector that safeguards the public and consumer interests tackling fraud and other criminal behaviour prevention of consumer detriment those same emotions are expressed albeit in a far more toned-down way in this report when it comes to online gambling
however consider the hypocrisy of this report
it talks about online gambling in this negative and detrimental way but it says nothing about the state monopolies that are hiding behind the emotive language to continue to drive out private innovative competitors
let us be honest in this debate as to what it is all about
it is about keeping state monopolies and we know where that leads to it leads down the road to serfdom
