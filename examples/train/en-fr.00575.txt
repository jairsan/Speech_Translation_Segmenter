madam president i have never supported the admission of non-european turkey into the eu but the current economic downturn makes me more convinced than ever of that view
as a huge net contributor the united kingdom carries a disproportionate burden in funding the eu so when it comes to the massive additional cost of enlargement to include turkey we would be burdened beyond what we could bear
with a reduced tax base falling income and increased welfare outlay and a crippling debt legacy in the future decades arising from the mismanagement of the labour government we cannot go on taking out our diminishing cheque book to pay for turkish enlargement
call that narrow mercenary national interest if you will but to me it is inescapable common and fiscal sense
