i would like to thank the commissioner for his answer as well
with regard to the specific issue of anglo is it the view of the commission that anglo is different to the existing clearing banks as we call them in ireland like allied irish banks bank of ireland ulster bank and so on
secondly with regard to the clarification that he was talking about is this also linked into the proposal coming forward from the government in ireland tomorrow with regard to the banking finance facility which is being discussed with the imf and with the european central bank
