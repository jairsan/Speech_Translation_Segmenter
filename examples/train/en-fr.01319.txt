mr president can i begin by wishing the high representative baroness ashton well in the many challenges that she faces during her mandate
as she knows well and as the united nations has stated the situation in haiti is the worst humanitarian disaster in decades as the numbers of missing people victims and deaths continue to rise
the human cost of this tragedy is immeasurable
while relief aid is beginning to arrive we are all aware of the significant problems that aid workers are facing in trying to get assistance to those that need it most
increasing security logistical and bureaucracy problems have been identified by the ngos on the ground as hampering aid and making a disastrous situation worse
these are the problems that are swaying the balance between life and death for haitians
in all the frayed work to alleviate the suffering and chaos clear leadership and coordinated assistance are needed
ngos government bodies international organisations and local authorities must work together to deliver multisector emergency assistance to those in need
it is clear that the country needs massive international support immediately
the response from european citizens and their record generosity and solidarity have been immense
yesterday's announcement of over eur four hundred and twenty million in european union humanitarian aid for haiti shows leadership and commitment but its delivery must be coordinated and effective
the european union's stated aim is to consolidate and strengthen the global relief effort
i hope that you mrs ashton and commissioner de gucht work strongly towards this aim in the respective visits to the united states haiti and elsewhere later this week
the long-term development of the poorest nation in the western hemisphere must become a priority
the allocation of eur two hundred million in european union aid to help haiti rebuild in the long term is a positive start but when the cameras have left and the world's attention is turned elsewhere the european union as a global leader must act and live up to its responsibility
