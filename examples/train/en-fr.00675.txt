mr president british conservatives are proud of our country's special relationship with the united states and the bridge between america and europe
we support president obama's commitment to multilateral engagement with the european union
however this report mentions the implementation of the lisbon treaty which we strongly oppose
it also calls for the us to abolish the death penalty which for us is a personal conscience issue
given the british conservatives current opposition to the international criminal court we also acknowledge america's right not to sign the rome statute
we also do not wish to be obliged to resettle dangerous terrorists from the guantánamo bay detention camp
this report rightly reiterates that nato is the cornerstone of transatlantic security and proposes a new transatlantic parliamentary assembly which will reinforce a mutual commitment to our common values of democracy liberty and human rights
therefore overall the british conservatives voted in favour of the millán mon report
