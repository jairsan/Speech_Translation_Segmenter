mr president during a visit of young israeli and palestinian leaders to the european parliament a thorough discussion was held which outlined a peace settlement for their future a secure and recognised two-state solution on the basis of the nineteen sixty-seven borders with jerusalem as the capital for both demilitarisation of the palestinian state the reiteration of the two thousand and seven arab peace initiative nato guarantees and the refugee issue to be arranged in a way that does not alter the demographic character of the hebrew state
while the young have a vision of a common future their seniors still argue about whether they should begin negotiations
the egyptian initiative for inter-palestinian reconciliation so that there is one interlocutor is still pondering and the security arrangement in gaza with the liberation of prisoners such as gilad shalit is still awaited
in the meantime the on the ground according to the report by the eu head of mission in east jerusalem renders the palestinian state less and less viable
i regret the fact that israel a democratic country pays little attention to the damage some of its actions create through the eyes of international public opinion and limits itself to damage limitation only afterwards
