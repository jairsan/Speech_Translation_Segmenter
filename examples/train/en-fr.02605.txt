mr president the volcanic ash crisis last year prompted the cancellation of close to one hundred zero flights resulting in absolute chaos for passengers
it is the effect that this crisis had on passengers that i wish to draw the commission's attention to today
over ten million people were affected and the cancellations resulted in significant economic costs for thousands of passengers
while airports have signs and leaflets informing travellers of their rights this is often of little use when faced with cancellations or major travel disruptions such as that caused by the ash cloud
under eu legislation passengers have a right to information and assistance from their airline
however in reality the majority of passengers whose travel has been disrupted will spend a lot of time and money chasing down information seeking alternative tickets or compensation with airlines
this is an issue that the commission needs be more effective on
the biggest frustration that passengers face in situations like this is trying to get information trying to get in contact with the airlines
although they are aware of their rights this is of little help to them if they are stranded in an airport or on hold to an airline
while i appreciate that at the time of the ash crisis airlines were under unprecedented pressure to deal with thousands of passengers and i must admit that some did admirably in general it is very difficult for people to get information and assistance when it is needed
the travel chaos as a result of the bad weather in december twenty ten further demonstrates this
passengers require up-to-date information but they need to be able to reach the airlines in order to exercise their rights
airlines airport customer services and information need to be more accessible to passengers whose travel has been disrupted
it is not enough to inform european union citizens of their passenger rights they must be assisted in exercising them in times of travel chaos
