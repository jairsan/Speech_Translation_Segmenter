if there is an overall global tax for financial transactions we should support it
in fact i have personally supported this in discussions in the european council
the european council has asked the commission to put forward some ideas on that and we are preparing it
also linked to the issue of innovative financing i personally believe that if we want to meet our obligations regarding the fight against climate change it cannot be only with the money from our budgets
it is obvious that our budgets are under such pressure that our national budgets alone over the next few years cannot provide the resources for fighting climate change
we have to think of innovative ways of financing
a global financial transaction tax seems to me a very good idea and we are working on that area in order to put forward proposals at an appropriate time
i hope the new commission will put forward some proposals in this area
