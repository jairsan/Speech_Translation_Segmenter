mr president of course much has changed in this last year
on twenty-three november this house itself reiterated the principle of the universality of human rights and non-discrimination as a basis on which to enhance our partnership with the jpa
this house also called for the reinforcement of the principle of non-negotiable human rights clauses and sanctions for failure to respect such clauses inter alia with regard to discrimination etc
based on sexual orientation
the fact is that these countries choose to work with us
they choose to have partnerships with us
we have the acp jpa we have the cotonou agreements
therefore we are asking them to engage with us on shared universal principles
these are non-negotiable
if they do not want to operate on that basis i call on the commission and the council to take the necessary sanctions to reinforce the fact that we have principles which we will stand up for
equally in the future of the eu-africa strategic partnership we urge that all actions conducted under the terms of the various partnerships be pursued without discrimination on any grounds including sexual orientation
it is not colonialism to stand up for the rights of others
human rights are universal and indivisible and to stand back and do nothing when somebody else's basic human rights are attacked is to be complicit in that action
you cannot promote homosexuality in africa
anyone in africa who woke up and said today i am going to be homosexual would be insane
their life would be under threat and their family would have to turn them in to the police
imagine you are that person and take the action necessary to defend those rights
