mr president while i deplore discrimination against any group in society on whatever grounds i cannot support this resolution
however this resolution seeks to place the responsibility for fighting discrimination into the eu context whereas i would argue that attitudes and approaches in member states are so varied that the interests of minority groups would be better addressed by member states and particularly by those member states who do not share the ideal of tolerance and equality that we british take for granted
i am aware for example that one italian mep a member of the efd group has been prosecuted for taking part in a vigilante raid in which he set fire to the belongings of an immigrant
this is unacceptable
please do not associate the british people with such behaviour by suggesting that minority groups in our country need the same levels of protection as the same poor soul that i have just referred to
