mr president it is imperative that if approved this week commissioner designate baroness ashton achieves the right balance between eu food security and food independence on the one hand and helping developing markets in promoting free trade on the other notwithstanding our existing relationship with acp nations which has been extremely important to them and us
the multilateral trade system has been an important contributor to global prosperity by opening up such markets and the world trade organisation wto has been most effective in providing a more level playing field for poorer nations
however any future wto agreement must not unnecessarily expose vital sectors of our eu economy
on currently available proposals future eu agricultural production would be threatened
it is predicted that in ireland alone the value of output from the beef sector could decline by eur one hundred and twenty million per year and overall the drop in agricultural output value across ireland could amount to up to eur four hundred and fifty million per annum
we must never agree to threaten the eu's strategic food security and the commissioner in her challenging new job would be wise to listen closely to the concerns of this parliament and observe the mandate she is given by eu governments
