madam president i support the report of the rapporteur and the work of the commission
there is no excuse for the poor state of refugee management in the eu since the numbers of asylum applications are low by historical standards
lack of common practice different sources of country-of-origin information and failure to implement eu laws properly means there is an uneven playing field
this is causing shopping-around by applicants and pass-the-parcel by states
another element creating unequal access to protection is that some member states are just deporting people before they can be assessed and even in effect bribing third countries to stop them coming
many arriving in mixed flows may well be economic migrants which does not make them criminals
however even if only a few are refugees they must be identified
as mr catania says protection in human rights concerns must be integrated into border management particularly in the mandate of frontex
people should not be detained just because they apply for asylum
besides the single common procedure and content of protection there needs to be practical cooperation support and solidarity including through the important european asylum support office providing common sources of country information
better quality and more accurate first decisions would save money through fewer costly appeals
obliging eu states to allow asylum seekers to work after six months if their claim is not decided is very important they would retain dignity and also pay tax
i am very disappointed the uk has decided to opt out from an improved reception conditions directive as that would bar automatic detention solely on the grounds of submission of an asylum claim cut across uk fast-track detention and enforce the right to work after six months
it is pretty shameful in my view that my own country regards these conditions as too onerous
