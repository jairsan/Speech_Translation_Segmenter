i am very pleased that mr higgins has asked his question
he is absolutely right about the situation he has described and you yourself commissioner have now acknowledged the facts of the case
will the commission in the light of this firstly suspend their gsp agreement with colombia and secondly suspend our negotiations for a free trade agreement until we get the assurances from the colombian government that trade unionists human rights activists and others can go about their business safely in that country
