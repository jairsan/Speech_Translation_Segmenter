mr president i would like to thank both rapporteurs for their work in this important area and also the commissioner for his support
passenger rights have always been a priority of the socialist group and this proposal completes the set following on from passenger rights in aviation and rail transport
it is vital that we all remember that the users of transport are the most important stakeholders a fact often forgotten by some transport companies
now for the first time we will have a set of basic rights for bus coach and ferry users that will ensure proper liability for cancellation and delays lost or damaged luggage as well as death in the event of accidents
perhaps more importantly we will have a series of fundamental rights for people with reduced mobility and special needs that will put an end to the victimisation endured by these people at the hands of transport companies over many years
no longer will transport operators be able to exclude people with reduced mobility from their vehicles no longer will people with reduced mobility have fewer rights than able-bodied people no longer should people with reduced mobility be excluded from the public transport network
who has delivered this
not a national or regional parliament but the european parliament
it is the european parliament that has put transport users at the top of our transport priorities
this is the european parliament putting people first and that is something that as socialists we can strongly support
