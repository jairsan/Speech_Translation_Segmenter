madam president as others have said the laval judgment and others did cause some controversy during the lisbon treaty debate in ireland and were used and abused in that regard
this report deals primarily with the principles of the internal market but it calls for equal treatment and equal pay for equal work and that has to be our guiding principle here today
social dumping is something of huge concern but could i just suggest that we will have a strange and unique situation in europe where countries like ireland that had an inflow of workers may yet see that situation change
it is in all our interests that our workers wherever they are in the european union have good and equal rights
could i also suggest that europe has a much greater problem staring it in the face the movement of entire businesses and companies outside the european union obviously taking the work and the economics of their business outside our borders while we simply import the results
that is an issue we have to tackle
