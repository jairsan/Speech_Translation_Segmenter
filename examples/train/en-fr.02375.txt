mr president this debate is a result of the implementation of the common immigration and asylum system enshrined in the lisbon treaty
member states lose even more control of their own destinies while having to pay the as yet unknown cost for the privilege
britain's asylum system is already a mess with thousands upon thousands of cases pending and applicants simply lost and gone to ground
the whole system is essentially a racket for those not eligible for legitimate immigration
i realise that i am wasting my breath in speaking about this here since most of you could not care less about preserving the democratic powers of the nation state
most of you are entranced in a grotesque fantasy world of endless eu integration like characters in some kind of painting by hieronymus bosch but the british people will one day hold to account the treasonous and treacherous politicians in britain who made this possible by denying them a referendum on the lisbon treaty
