mr president apologies that my voice is not particularly good although it is maybe just as well
i might have got angry with some of the comments from my colleague from sinn féin in relation to the treaty of lisbon
let me just say that in ireland we put the cart before the horse
we are actually having a very good debate about the treaty of lisbon since the vote
would it had been the other way around there is now some logic and sense being talked about it in ireland
and can i say to the battered bureaucrats and lobbyists that i have decided that you are some of the best thing we have
honestly you should bite back because it is ironic that sinn féin should talk about public services which are run by bureaucrats and yet condemn the very bureaucrats of these institutions
we wait to see what the irish government says next week
it does not have much public confidence at the moment so it may not be the best of times to talk about another vote if that is what has to happen
but i believe that there is sense prevailing in ireland and that people are now reflecting on the situation we find ourselves in and now know that we need to be at the heart of europe given the crisis that we are in
