mr president the commission notes parliament's call for more transparency dialogue and information on competition policy
we will continue to inform you about important policy decisions relating to competition and will endeavour to address your requests in our response to your resolution either in the next report on competition policy or on an ad hoc basis as requested by mr b√ºtikofer and other members
i note your call for sector inquiries in a number of markets
past experience shows that fair and firm enforcement itself produces positive effects on competition across a sector
sector inquiries are not always the best way to enforce our rules in a given sector
they are very expensive in terms of resources and should be used only when the commission's policy objectives make an inquiry necessary
i can confirm again that the temporary crisis-related state aid measures are indeed temporary
i would like to pick up on a few of your questions in a really telegraphic way in the limited time available
firstly on the investment and financial sector consultation is ongoing on rescue and restructuring guidelines
secondly on transport the commission is preparing a white paper on the future of transport which is due to be adopted in march twenty eleven
this will outline several proposals for speeding up completion of the internal market for transport
thirdly on services of general economic interest the commission will report on this in the first quarter of this year
fourthly on the digital agenda the commission fully agrees with the importance of promoting a truly integrated digital internal market
fifthly on smes a level playing field for all companies big and small is essential for them to flourish
the commission's enforcement of the competition rules is essential to enable this
we also have targeted state aid rules for smes innovation research and development and green technologies
next june vice-president almunia will present to you the report on competition policy twenty ten
in the meantime he will keep you informed on the issues you have raised and in relation to paragraph four of parliament's report the services of dg comp will be instructed to respond to you in more detail
