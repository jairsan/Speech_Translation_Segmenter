mr president i should like to thank members very much for their views and the commissioner for his views
we are right to have this review of this legislation
it is right to refine reduce and replace animal testing wherever possible
we are right to keep the momentum going
both industry and animal welfare organisations believe this is necessary
this is an issue which i believe goes well beyond politics and is very much a moral issue that we must get right
i for one am very disappointed if he were here i would say it to him clearly that graham watson has made a personal attack on me in my own region making this a highly political issue
this is regrettable because we need to come forward with a sensible proposal in the end
a lot of technical expertise and work has been put into this report
we do not deliver this report lightly
we have put serious work into it and we have good compromises
i have sought to bring all sides together to deliver a report which is right for parliament right for research and industry and right for animal welfare
i would urge all to support it because if we do not get it through we face delaying the report for a couple of years and this would be detrimental to the industry and to animal welfare
so i would urge all members to support it
if there are groups here that decide to vote against it i think in the long run all it will do is delay what is a good proposal one which will help to make sure there is research available in the european union to help with disease control and new medicine while at the same time reducing the number of animals we need to use and actually strengthening ecvam in looking for alternatives
so i would urge all members to vote for it because we want a really resounding result in the morning
