i am grateful to both and i understand the passion and strength of feeling
i am not convinced that suspending negotiations will achieve what both honourable members would wish to achieve
what i think we have to do is to continue the dialogue continue working to include in our discussions and more importantly in our agreements an absolute guarantee along the lines that both honourable members are looking for
that is the approach that i have taken
it does not mean i hasten to add that i have not invited those who have already talked to me to continue with their contribution to making sure that we are on the right lines and of course i keep it under review but at the present time that is the course of action i have decided upon
