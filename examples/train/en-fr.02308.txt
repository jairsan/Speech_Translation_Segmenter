mr president like many mothers i want decent animal welfare standards but i also want affordable eggs
i am not a poultry expert and my daughter's four attempts to keep pet chickens have all fallen prey to the local fox
therefore i would rather listen to the professionals like the farmer the keeper of thirty zero happy eu-compliant hens that i visited in my constituency last month
in the uk the pig-farming industry learnt to its great cost the mistake of introducing higher animal welfare standards unilaterally
the uk's egg farmers put their confidence in the commission and have invested hundreds of millions of pounds getting ready for this legislation
public confidence in the eu is at an all-time low
you must protect those who have complied in good faith with this legislation
it is not time to play chicken with the egg farmers
