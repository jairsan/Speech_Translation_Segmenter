again we repeat here that healthcare and health delivery are a competence of the member states
the commission has in fact issued its guidelines on breast screening and we have been pushing member states to abide by these guidelines and introduce breast-screening programmes into their countries as fast as possible
i can say that in most countries we do have adequate and very good breast-screening programmes which are bearing results other countries unfortunately are still a little slow
i can assure you that in all the contacts that we have with the member states this is one of the priority areas that we discuss
