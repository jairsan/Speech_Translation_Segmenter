as you said mr karas there is no decision yet
there was a first debate with the finance ministers and in fact the commission will present a communication next month on reinforced economic governance
we aim to reinforce the preventive and corrective arm of the stability and growth pact
we will make proposals for a more effective and broader surveillance of intra-euro area macro-economic imbalances and we will explore the options for the creation of a crisis resolution mechanism but we will concentrate on substance
we believe it is possible with the current treaties to do much more in terms of surveillance of the euro area and of the economic and monetary union if there is indeed a willingness on the part of the member states to cooperate and respect the treaties
