madam president i also supported this vote
there is no question that we need a regulatory system for pesticides
this is not in dispute
the kla√ü report extends the range of controls and limits the use of ppps to essential use
interestingly while there was a very vexed debate on hazard-versus-risk on the breyer report i have always felt that this issue is more suitable to the actual use as distinct from placing on the market in other words this report
a wide range of common products can be hazardous if the handling and usage instructions are ignored
being on the market in itself is not a risk to the consumer the environment or the user of such products
pesticides are only hazardous if the handler does not know what he or she is doing if the application equipment is faulty if the aquatic environment is ignored or if they are improperly stored and not part of an integrated pest-management plan
the concept of quantitative use reduction needs careful management as less frequent spraying with higher concentration of pesticide could result
at the end of the day these substances must be used to the least extent possible as every farmer knows
