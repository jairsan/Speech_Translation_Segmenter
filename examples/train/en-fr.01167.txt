mr president the stockholm programme is part of creating a common legal and judicial system across the european union
the document talks about making people's lives easier a europe of law and justice
let me tell you what your common legal system has done for the life of one person
andrew symeou a twenty year-old london man was extradited to greece this summer on a manslaughter charge
he now languishes in a greek prison awaiting trial
the evidence against him would not stand up for five minutes if examined by a british court
the identification evidence is contradictory
witness statements have all the signs of having been written by the police
two witnesses claim they were beaten and mistreated and forced to sign statements which they later immediately withdrew
the appeal court in london knew very well there was no real evidence against mr symeou but they were forced to extradite him because under the european arrest warrant they had no power to stop it
the british courts cannot now protect british citizens from unjust arrest and imprisonment by foreign courts
we had a perfectly good area of freedom security and justice in britain before we joined the european union
the european union is destroying the legal protections that we enjoyed in england for centuries
in the process it will destroy people's lives
the stockholm programme may be about law but it is not about justice
if the british people want to preserve their liberties then they have to leave the european union
