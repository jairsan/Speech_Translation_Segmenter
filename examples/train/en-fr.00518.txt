mr president i shall be brief
i voted in favour of this report because anything that improves road safety has to be welcomed
i have an additional point
we have concerns in ireland about road safety issues
when roads are being maintained by local authorities we have had some terrible tragedies on these roads and this is an issue that perhaps needs to be looked at from a european point of view and standards put in place
