mr president i welcome proposals to help the outermost regions
firstly agriculture is primarily an industry that puts food on the table without which we all would die but also these regions without agriculture would die as well both economically and by probably becoming denuded of people
so i welcome any proposals to help them
i also want to add my voice to those who expressed concern about the mercosur proposals
these could do enormous damage to the outermost regions and indeed every region
i think that it is time that the european union got stronger and fairer with its own farmers
we were never meant to be the policeman for the farmers within the union and the fairy godmother for the farmers in the rest of the world
that is what is happening here there would be less stringent rules less transparency and less accountability for food coming into the european union than for food that is produced within it and that would be unfair to the outermost regions and to all regions
