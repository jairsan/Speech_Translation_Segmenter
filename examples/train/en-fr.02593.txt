mr president we are concerned about the worsening situation in belarus which unfortunately comes as no surprise
the widespread detention and prosecution of civil society activists including presidential candidates in the post-election period led us to expect harsh sentences to follow
as of today we already know of four cases where individuals have been sentenced to several years in prison
we fear that many more such sentences involving up to forty people who now stand accused will follow in months to come
what is more we have been appalled by reports of the torture and ill-treatment of people detained on political grounds including ex-presidential candidate mikhalevich
all these despicable events may call for an update of our eu response
the situation today is as follows as you know the eu reacted to the fraudulent elections of nineteen december and to the subsequent repression by putting nearly one hundred and sixty people on a sanction list
this was a very clear and strong message of condemnation to the authorities
at the same time the commission and the european external action service have swiftly designed new dedicated assistance tools to provide urgent support to the victims of repression their families and civil society up to an amount of eur one point seven million
this assistance is being delivered with the initial focus on providing legal assistance and counselling to victims of repression and on support to civil society organisations and civic campaigns
we are also finalising a re-orientation of our mid-term assistance to belarus to increase support to civil society
the commission is quadrupling its aid to belarusian civil society for the period twenty eleven twenty thirteen to a total of eur fifteen point six million with particular attention given to strengthening independent media and supporting students including by maintaining funding for the european humanities university
it is now time to reflect on whether an additional response is needed
the high representative issued an immediate condemnation following the first sentence on eighteen february and she recalled that political motives had no place in a legal process
the eu also strongly condemned the harsh sentences and torture allegations at the osce and is discussing the matter at the un human rights council
finally the european union will discuss whether the latest events call for a further expansion of our existing sanction list to add new names such as those responsible for issuing the latest sentences and leading the recent crackdown
the eu stands ready to consider further targeted measures in all areas of cooperation as appropriate
parliament's resolution will certainly be a useful and timely contribution to our reflections and discussions
i thank members for their attention
