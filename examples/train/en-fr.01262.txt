mr president may i welcome the presence of the new high representative in the chamber and also the strong council conclusions on the middle east steered by the swedish presidency
on the goldstone report i would like to congratulate mr bildt on behalf of the presidency for praising the and i quote credibility and high integrity of the goldstone report
i do think it would be useful if mrs malmstr√∂m could repeat today in the european parliament what her ambassador said in the united nations that the eu urges israel and the palestinians to launch appropriate credible and independent domestic investigations of human rights violations in relation to the gaza conflict
finally can i ask the presidency and the high representative if they are aware of the british government guidance adopted last week for food labelling to distinguish between imports originating from the palestinian territories and those from illegal israeli settlements and tell us what plans they have for extending this advice to the european level
as electors we can choose to pay the costs of peace
as consumers we do not want to subsidise the price of conflict
