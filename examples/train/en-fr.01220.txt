madam president the debate prior to this was about hunger
these two debates are linked
the commissioner is right to do what she can to ensure consumer protection in europe and colleagues in this chamber are right to hold her to account and to hold the highest standards
but beef is a cash crop
it is produced as cheaply as countries can produce it
tragically to produce one kilogram of beef takes one hundred times more water than to produce one kilogram of soya
if we are concerned about consumer protection worldwide we will do two things
first we will help third countries more to develop the kinds of systems of traceability that they need and second we will follow the advice of my colleague chris davies in the last debate in encouraging all of our citizens to stop eating meat
