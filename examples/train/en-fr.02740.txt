mr president for the sixteenth year the court of auditors has only given a qualified statement of assurance which means for the sixteenth year public confidence in the integrity of the management of our financial affairs has been undermined
i recognise that the commission has made efforts to make improvements but in voting to grant discharge i can only vote outcomes not intent
the auditors report that far too many headings are materially affected by error and since eighty of our spending is under shared management with the member states it is perfectly clear that the member states must accept greater responsibility
it is clear too that the commission must give greater urgency to achieving that outcome
so until i see evidence of significant improvement i shall continue to vote against discharge of the budget
