madam president the new austerity package for greece which includes eur twenty-eight billion of cuts and taxes and the privatisation of an incredible eur fifty billion worth of state assets confirms again the role of the eu and the imf as enforcers for anti-worker austerity policies
young people have been on the receiving end of their vicious attacks
they are now fighting back with hundreds of thousands occupying squares across europe bravely facing down brutal repression
they have correctly raised the call for true democracy
in my opinion that can only be truly achieved by breaking the dictatorship of the markets and building a democratic socialist society where people's needs come before profits
fifteen june promises to be an important day of struggle across europe
a general strike will take place in greece and a major demonstration is planned in barcelona
big protests should be organised right across europe against austerity on that day
to defeat the onslaught against workers and young people in europe the power of the organised working class must be mobilised
a one-day general strike across europe would send a very powerful message of opposition to the european establishment
