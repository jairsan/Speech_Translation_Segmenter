mr president i should like to thank richard seeber for his commitment in this most important area
i fully support the movement towards a water-efficient and water-saving economy and of course the full implementation of the water framework directive which i was very involved in a few years ago when my former austrian colleague marilies flemming was the rapporteur
in fact the contents of article nine of the water framework directive to which i would like to draw attention tonight were a result of an amendment i made to the original draft proposal
i would like an assurance from the commission that any proposals regarding water pricing or compulsory water metering if it should arise would be expressed in accordance with article nine of the water framework directive which allows for the continuation of the established irish practice of not charging domestic householders for domestic usage
please do not ask me to justify the sustainability of this to you here and now but please believe me that it is a matter of acute political sensitivity and one if i may suggest best handled by irish governments rather than under an eu directive
we are a wet island off the west of europe but we too are facing shortage as we consider the impact of climate change on water
