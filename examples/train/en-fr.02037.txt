madam president how typical of the greens to sneer at those who dare to disagree
we dare to disagree with a small part of these proposals therefore we must be derided
i applaud your commitment to these proposals indeed i agree with the vast majority of them but there are one or two parts that i do not agree with
so i can applaud your commitment but i cannot applaud your tolerance
come back in thirty years time and preach to me about advancing women's rights when you have done as much work on this as i have
i will not be pigeon-holed as regressive
there are aspects of these proposals which are regressive the idea that european women should have more european babies in an overpopulated world is socially regressive
to impose twenty weeks fully-paid maternity leave in the uk i cannot explain our system quickly enough here is financially regressive
a disproportionate number of higher paid women in the uk will receive the vast majority of the extra gbp two billion
it will not go to the lower paid women whom i think we would all want to help the most
so where is the progression
member states are best placed to decide these details the principles of subsidiarity should apply
