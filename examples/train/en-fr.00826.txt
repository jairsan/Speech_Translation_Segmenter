madam president as one of the other co-sponsors of the original written declaration nearly three years ago which called for this ban i should like to congratulate everyone who has worked to bring this draft proposal forward
four hundred and twenty-five members of this house signed that declaration reflecting the strength of feeling about the issue not only among meps but also among our constituents
today nearly one million seals are slaughtered annually in commercial seal kills around the world and when we vote on this package tomorrow we will be helping to end one of the most vile examples of animal cruelty
i am very glad that compromises like the proposed labelling system have been strongly rejected so that we can fully meet the demands of millions of european citizens
a positive vote will be a vote for ending cruelty
it will also be a vote and a victory for all of us who have refused to take no for an answer
i well remember many meetings with commission officials when we were told that a ban would be simply impossible
well this just shows that when we can galvanise sufficient political will and i pay tribute to the ngos which have helped us to do so then impossible things become possible and i am delighted that they do
