madam president a month ago you and i paid our second visit of the year to gaza
others have trod in our footsteps javier solana has been there tony blair has finally made it and the president of parliament has been there to see for himself the circumstances in which palestinians are now living
this parliament asked for the economic blockade to be lifted but to a very large extent it continues
week after week the collective punishment of palestinian people is maintained by the israelis
our words are fine but they have little value while israel refuses to listen
madam vice-president i ask you to ask the president to call a meeting of the group leaders and his cabinet to consider how our words can be turned into deeds
i face the question all the time from my constituents you have an association agreement with israel
how is it that we maintain this relationship with one side while that party ignores our interests and treats our words with such contempt
