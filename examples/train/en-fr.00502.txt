madam president i am delighted that we continue to take mental health with some seriousness and some priority here in this house
it must remain high on the eu health policy agenda as one in four people will experience a depressive illness at least once in their lives and by twenty twenty it will be the most common illness in the developing world
however i am afraid that in member states including my own country we have the theory we talk the talk
our mental health policy is articulated in a document called and many of the calls for action in the rapporteur's report are stated in our national policy or indeed are enshrined in our legislation
but i am afraid the coalface delivery of mental health services continues to be completely unfit for purposes
there is a huge disconnection taking place between the theories and the reports and we are always particularly in my country an action plan away from action
i am afraid mental health services and delivery to those who require them continue to be the cinderella area of most mental health policies in all our member states
this must change
