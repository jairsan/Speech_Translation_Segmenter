mr president i welcome this report and its conclusion that there is no need for a constitutional convention
such a convention would merely serve to waste time and taxpayers money
indeed there is no appetite amongst my constituents for a convention which would no doubt discuss further political integration
indeed the balance of opinion in britain is that political union has already progressed too far
whilst i welcome the measures that enable the eighteen additional meps to take their seats i do not believe that they should enjoy observer status until the transitional provisions come into force
such a move would entitle them to claim their salaries and expenses before they are entitled to vote and i believe as a matter of principle that that is wrong
at a time when large cuts in public expenditure are anticipated in almost every member state this parliament should set an example
we should be prudent with public money at all times
my group will vote against this report because it disregards that important principle
