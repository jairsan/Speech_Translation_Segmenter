mr president thank you for your indulgence
i wanted to mention two other points in my contribution
the issue of eggs in shell is quite visible and clear
there is however a massive market for processed eggs for the confectionery sector and we need to know what sort of labelling requirements there will be for that product
i think this is where we have the greatest concerns because more and more eggs are going into the processing sector and my fear is that we will export our cages from the european union and then import liquid-egg and dried-egg products from those very systems in third countries
i see you nodding in agreement
this is a very real problem for the european union
my other concern relates to parallel production systems and a huge problem in the marketplace if we have enriched cages coming into production while the current systems remain in production
that could cause major problems for producers and ultimately for consumers
so the commission has a huge balancing act to get this right
