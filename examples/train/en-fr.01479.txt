mr president it seems to me that the three key words in this debate are independent equal and neutral
there needs to be an independent investigation into alleged breaches of human rights
there has to be equal condemnation of the perpetrators of those breaches and above all there is need for a powerful neutral voice to mediate in this unfortunate conflict something that is sadly lacking at the minute because the position of the vast majority of powerful countries is fairly well known
i think there is a wonderful opportunity for the high representative or the newly created president of the council to supply that neutral voice something similar to what george mitchell did in northern ireland as a result of which we now have peace and people who were shooting and killing one another for years are now in government together
that same opportunity is there for the high representative to supply that neutral independent and fair voice that is so sadly lacking
