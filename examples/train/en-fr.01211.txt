madam president in eighteen century england thomas malthus predicted that population increase would exceed food supply
now in many ways his ideas have been discredited because we have had a series of agricultural revolutions which have transformed our society
but his words were also true in the lifetimes of many of us world population has trebled trebled quite incredible and in too many parts of the world that has exceeded our food supply
we need to be doing more if we want to prevent hunger and control population growth and the way of doing that is to ensure that women everywhere have control over their reproductivity
and we have got to save the lives of children
the best way of reducing population growth is to save the lives of youngsters so that people do not feel the need to have bigger families
here in the western world we are addicted to eating meat a massive waste of resources
all i can say is and i see my time is up madam president as someone who gave up eating meat twenty years ago if we want to save the world and prevent hunger then we eat green not red
