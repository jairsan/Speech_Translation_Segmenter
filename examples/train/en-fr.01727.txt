madam president the review conference of the international criminal court icc is a long awaited and important event in the evolution of the court itself and more broadly international criminal justice
the review conference is a good opportunity for the stakeholders to consider the existing deficiencies of the icc and propose possible changes or directions for reform
i would like to mention several issues that eu member states as well as the ep delegation should have on the agenda
one of the issues is certainly the position of our transatlantic partners on the icc
i would like to point out that the lack of participation of the united states in the icc is the single most important factor reducing the relevance and authority of the icc
it would therefore be very useful if our american partners could express more clearly their current position and commitment to the icc
i would also like to urge the eu to insist on discussing and hopefully revising article one hundred and twenty-four also known as the transitional provision of the rome statute which allows states to choose not to have their nationals subject to the icc's jurisdiction over war crimes for a seven-year period after the ratification of the statute
this is a regrettable loophole that should be removed from the rome statute
last but not least i would like to point out that the eu should strive for the widest ratification and implementation of the rome statute in relations with those countries that have not yet done so
it must be an objective of the eu during the enlargement negotiations and accession phases of the new eu member states
it should be high on the agenda in our dealings with russia as well especially taking into account the fact that we are currently negotiating the modalities of the partnership agreement with our russian partners
