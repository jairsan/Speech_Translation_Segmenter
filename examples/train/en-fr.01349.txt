mr president i have good news for the house in common with many scientists i personally have concluded that there is no climate crisis global sea levels are not rising significantly and as the ipcc has been forced to admit himalayan glaciers are not in rapid retreat
the small increase in mean global temperatures over the last hundred years is entirely consistent with well-established long-term natural climate changes
copenhagen showed that many nations especially china and india are simply not prepared to sacrifice economic performance to solve an entirely speculative problem
in britain a majority of voters no longer believe in man-made climate change and they will not pay for futile and pointless attempts at mitigation
the recent leaked cru memos show that even the high priests of climate alarmism are in despair at the failure of nature to follow their forecasts so they are falsifying the figures to sustain their fantasy
we must now demand a full public inquiry into the suspect data before we spend another penny on mitigation
