mr president i shall start by thanking all the rapporteurs for their efforts but especially mrs kalniete for all her hard work and for the leadership of our chair malcolm harbour
the uk government estimates that the value of a true single market would add up to eur eight hundred billion of the eu's gdp a truly astonishing figure
there is still much to do to deliver this
improving governance of the single market must be a key strategic priority for the eu
it is vital that in these difficult economic times we look to enhance our competitiveness increase growth create jobs and drive innovation
i am pleased with the outcome of this report which stresses the importance of a clear commitment and ownership by member states to relaunch the single market which is vital for its success
by carrying out a rigorous monitoring process and by reducing the time it takes to transpose directives member states will be able to increase trade and ensure a well-functioning single market
i am also very supportive of the priority action highlighted in mr correia de campos report in relation to the mutual recognition of professional qualifications for which i will be the rapporteur
we must urgently identify the obstacles faced by member states in implementing this directive and by the professionals themselves
