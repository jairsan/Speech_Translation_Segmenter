mr president i have seen for myself how important cohesion policy is for wales and i therefore welcome the lastra report on cohesion policy and europe twenty twenty
there are many projects right across wales that are benefiting individuals and communities
so i have no doubt that structural funds can help deliver the twenty twenty goals
however i would like to make the following points
the twenty twenty strategy the fifth cohesion report and the budget must all be aligned
in future structural funds should be properly financed the structural funds should not be renationalised and the transitional status should be made available to those regions that fall out of convergent status
if we can achieve all these things i certainly believe that the cohesion policy can help us deliver twenty twenty
it would also make the eu twenty twenty strategy relevant to individuals and citizens right across europe
