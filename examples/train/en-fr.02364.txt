mr president i want to begin by reminding us of the words of the universal declaration
i quote freedom either alone or in community with others and in public or private to manifest religion or belief in teaching practice worship and observance
it makes the point that protection of these freedoms is integral to and inseparable from the protection of all human rights
our determination to defend them should be no less
it also makes clear that we should act against all religious persecution which is a problem for all religions and in many countries including let us be honest some of the countries of our own european union
the pew centre says that seventy of the world's six billion people live in countries with strong restrictions on religious belief or practice
i personally have a strong conviction that religion can be a force for good upheld by the work of the faith council in my own east-of-england constituency which promotes mutual understanding a role mirrored in the european union's own obligations for dialogue as outlined in our resolution
but i know that when preacher of hate terry jones who threatened to burn the koran said he would come to luton also in my constituency to stir up religious hatred he was told he would not be welcome
tolerance dialogue mutual respect and understanding are for some parts of their faith
for others they are values in their own right
either way they are values that we should promote and respect
