mr president first of all i have to congratulate the rapporteur mr vidal-quadras for his excellent work on this important report
every winter reminds us that europe is dependent on the gas supply from russia ukraine and other countries
security of energy supply has become a priority for the eu and this is most welcome
this legislation is a positive step towards reducing europe's vulnerability and assuring our citizens that gas will be delivered in the event of serious disruption prices will be affordable and solidarity will prevail
but more needs to be done
we need to continue diversifying energy routes and supply sources
security of energy supply has a different meaning depending on whether you are romanian dutch or finnish
our various geopolitical situations require a european approach and the european approach requires full completion of the energy market
it is not a scoop to state that many protectionist barriers remain within the eu
protectionism is harming the market and therefore harming consumers keeping prices up and undermining our security of supply
what is a scoop though is for a politician to say that politics should back off from energy policy and i am saying that loud and clear
every day we hear about ambiguous contracts deals agreed behind closed doors monopolies and political arrangements
in romania the shaping of our energy strategy is in the hands of a few people in the security council led by the president
accountability
not for the romanians
democracy
not for the romanians
and yet the consequences of this policy end up in their hands of the citizens of romania when they receive their pricey gas bills at the end of the year
it is time to ask for more transparency accountability and democracy in the way our member states deal with energy policy
otherwise we will not be able to improve the situation for consumers
let the free market regulate prices it will undoubtedly do a better job than politicians
we need the commission to dismantle protectionist barriers and behaviour patterns
