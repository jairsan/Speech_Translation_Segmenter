china enjoys a large surplus on its balance of trade with the eu
europe's surplus in services is too small to compensate for this
china achieves its trade surplus by an artificially low value of its currency by suppressed wage rates so that imports into china cannot be afforded and so that export prices are considerably lower than european prices and thirdly by ignoring international patent rights so that chinese companies can benefit from research and development not carried out by themselves
china is rapidly accumulating foreign currency reserves and control over scarce global resources
european countries are becoming the willing victims of a relentless global competitor with the instrument to destruct our livelihoods
european countries must individually my preference or collectively protect our industries
why does the commission allow eu business and workers to suffer unfair competition from china
