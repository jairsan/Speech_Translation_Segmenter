madam president firstly i would like to thank everybody who has participated in this debate
it has been a very constructive debate
i welcome in particular the support parliament has given me and my colleagues on the committee on the internal market and consumer protection for the significant improvements we have made on the users rights and data privacy elements of the directive
i was delighted that during the course of the debate everybody contributed on those aspects
they are important for every consumer
coming up to the elections i hope that all of you will talk about the work you have been doing in this house for consumers in the internet world because it is absolutely crucial
i think my second and important reflection is that the internet space itself electronic communications the sector itself is a thriving evolving and dynamic sector
our task as regulators is to allow that dynamism that innovation to continue
we put in place a framework of regulation to ensure that consumers can engage with that to give them the right to know about those services to empower them to take advantage of that that is crucial
but the internet is not the thriving place it is and you have seen how dynamic it is because of the mail you have been getting about this proposal it is not there because we have been restricting activity on the internet it is not there because we have been imposing new business models
we have been shackling the things that people have done
we want new entrants to come in we want small businesses we want large businesses we want investment
it is that sense of dynamism and urgency that we need to move forward
mrs reding is right we must encourage member states to get these improvements in place as soon as possible
we want the new berec operating we want the new regulatory body to engage with us in parliament to ensure that these things happen as quickly as possible
let us move on from here and look towards the future
thank you commissioner for the key declarations that you made in the areas of data protection and universal service which will enable us to work with you to make progress in these crucial areas
