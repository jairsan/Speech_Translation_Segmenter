madam president i too would like to join the calls for a european directive on freedom of information freedom of the press and media pluralism
although this has been a debate about freedom of information in italy as other speakers have said there are serious issues in other countries in the european union
one of these is the united kingdom
rupert murdoch has already been mentioned and one of the reasons i believe we need this directive is because of rupert murdoch
rupert murdoch is not a head of state but he is an international media mogul with his own very particular agenda
he is not democratic and we need to legislate for the likes of rupert murdoch as well as for the likes of silvio berlusconi
