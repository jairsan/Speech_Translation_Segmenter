mr president i will stick specifically to agriculture
first of all i have to admit that i am a farmer but i do not have pigs i do not have poultry though i do have a greenhouse in the garden
i think it is very important that the commissioner realises that as has already been said it is specifically designed for industry
commissioner i beg that you rethink the situation when it comes to the directives on agriculture
we already know that agriculture is under huge pressure
we have heard many times in this chamber the question of food security
please reconsider the amendments which are particularly damaging to it
i think that many of the amendments that are not connected with agriculture are extremely good and i congratulate mr vernola on his report
commissioner you talked in your presentation about distorting competition
i am going to ask you a simple question and please try to answer it today
will you put in place legislation to stop imports of foodstuffs coming into the european union which are not reared to the same standards as we have in the european union
