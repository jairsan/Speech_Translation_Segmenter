madam president there is much to commend the council conclusions as we look to the future perhaps less so when we deal with the present and the past
i was interested in the comments made by catherine day a senior commission official in ireland last week when she said that the shine had gone off ireland
i hope that does not mean each of us individually and i hope that given the results of the stress tests and the very strong action of the new government the shine will come back to ireland
i hope too that it comes back to our people who are very depressed and disillusioned by a feeling that they carry a very heavy burden for the rest of the european union
i would ask those who wag their fingers in anger about incorrect behaviour by individual countries and citizens to please remember that there were others who also joined in at the party i speak of european banks who tried to profit from the boom that existed not just in ireland but elsewhere
however there is a ray of hope in the irish media this morning
i see that global finance giants are backing our economy in the wake of the stress tests and i hope that they realise that the irish have fixed a problem for the rest of europe and will show us much-needed solidarity on interest rates
