now we are into a completely different policy area
the commission is perfectly aware of the poverty which combined with other factors such as instability climate change and human rights violations drives migrants to embark on a hard sometimes tragic journey
the commission is active on all these fronts primarily via the political dialogue conducted with these countries and via the european development fund and its aim of combating poverty
in response to the tragic events in ceuta and melilla and as part of the global approach approved by the european council in late two thousand and five the european union wanted a structured dialogue with africa on the link between migration and development under the rabat process in respect of the west african migratory route shortly to be followed up by the paris conference on twenty-five november and the tripoli process in respect of africa as a whole
the partnership on migration mobility and employment was launched at the december two thousand and seven eu-africa summit in lisbon
the underlying idea is that the partnership should find solutions to migration by linking it to employment issues
the migration information and management centre inaugurated by the development and humanitarian aid commissioner and malian president tour√© in bamako on six october exemplifies the practical application of the integrated approach that the commission is striving to promote
it is moreover ready to reproduce this example elsewhere in west africa
as regards migrants living conditions one of the objectives of the migration and asylum programme is to protect migrants rights inter alia by strengthening the capacity of administrations and stakeholders in countries of transit or destination such as the north african countries to assist migrants especially in certain conditions
by way of example the european community has recently granted funding under the programme for the following projects the continuing financing of the libya office of the high commissioner for refugees which plays a key role in promoting the rights of refugees and asylum seekers improving the protection of the living conditions of international migrants in north africa strengthening the capacity of civil society organisations in the area of promoting the rights of migrants in north africa and a programme enabling migrants in libyan morocco to return home voluntarily in decent conditions
lastly the commission is using the programme to finance many projects in sub-saharan africa addressing the prevention of illegal immigration the promotion of legal migration the link between migration and development and the promotion of refugee and asylum-seeker advocacy
