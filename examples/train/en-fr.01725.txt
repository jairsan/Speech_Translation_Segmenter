madam president i think when we introduced decoupling few of us realised the implications of making cross compliance part of the package which farmers now need to comply with
i think it is over seventeen different directives
perhaps we should ask ourselves in this house how well we legislate for simplification
however there is one particular area that i want to comment on and that is the area of inspections
we have the overarching inspection for cross compliance by competent authorities but farmers are increasingly facing other levels and layers of inspections from processors from retailers from all sorts of groups we need a little bit of coordination and not duplication of inspections
they do not add any value or any degree of safety or security to the final product but they add a huge amount of bureaucracy and frustration for the producers who are required to meet and greet all of these inspectors
i welcome this report
