mr president i think the commissioner said at the outset and he was correct that we need to learn the lessons from the financial crisis and take measures to ensure that it does not happen again
he is absolutely right in that and obviously the lisbon treaty gives us stronger control over those situations because in the recent past the real lesson to be learnt is that politics and politicians were not in control that we allowed bankers regulators and rating agencies to do as they wished and we see now where we are as a result of it
we must ensure that that never happens again and we as politicians and particularly here in the european union have to take control because we are supposed to be in control and everybody else should fall into line beneath that observe the law and ensure that proper practices are operated on a daily basis
