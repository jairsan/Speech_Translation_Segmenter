mr president a year ago we debated here in this chamber what actions were necessary to tackle the global financial crisis
at the time some of my group's proposals on economic governance were dismissed as too ambitious and too far-reaching but today i am happy to note that several of our suggestions are realities
today however there is a significant gap between the ambitions declared in the europe twenty twenty strategy and the financial resources needed to attain the goals
in the draft twenty twelve budget the commission needs to clarify clearly identify and make visible the expenditure related to the strategy
this is also true for the upcoming revision of the multiannual financial framework
i would also like to address the member states directly
there is a clear unwillingness in the council among the finance ministers including my own anders borg from sweden to invest in the future
national budgets need to reflect the council's stated ambitions and eu projects need budgets if they are ever to happen
mark my words without the money in the right place there will be no growth and jobs strategy and we risk failure
i therefore urge the commission to come forward with more concrete legislative proposals and the member states to show more commitment
we need binding commitments to reach headline targets and legislation in key job-creating areas such as energy efficiency targets at a common european level
existing initiatives such as the strategic energy technology plan the lifelong learning programme and the energy efficiency action plan have already been adopted but you in the council failed to bring the money to the table
we need financing of these projects
they all have the potential to create jobs and growth
with our twenty twenty resolution the alde group sends a strong message to the council that the current governance structure is too weak the method of open coordination has failed and the community method should be restored
i applaud the huge majority behind the joint resolution
this is a strong message from parliament that we need action
