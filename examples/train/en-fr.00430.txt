i would like to thank the commissioner for his response and to welcome the fact that he repeated the commission's condemnation of israel's action
but commissioner all our trade agreements have a human rights clause in them
i like many of my voters fail to understand how when a country admits it is using disproportionate military action against a civilian population it deliberately targets schools it deliberately targets the buildings of peaceful and neutral international organisations we still do not believe it has breached its human rights clauses
when will a breach of human rights occur if not in these circumstances
