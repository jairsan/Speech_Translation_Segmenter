mr president over sixty of irish adults are overweight or obese and similar figures can be found across europe
this regulation will help us tackle not only this obesity crisis but also other health problems such as diabetes stroke and heart disease
unfortunately the current industry-developed gda labelling system is complex arguably misleading and generally misunderstood
traffic light food labelling is a simple universally understood and transparent system that health and consumer groups support and many health-conscious food producers have already voluntarily and successfully adapted
i also believe that alcohol producers should label their products for calories and sugar in a similar fashion
nobody has yet offered me one good reason why alcohol should be excluded
we all know there has been massive industry pressure on this piece of legislation
i urge my fellow meps to resist this pressure and take a pro-health stance by supporting traffic light and alcohol labelling in tomorrow's vote
