mr president as the previous speaker said and as the commissioner said this is a deeply complex problem so the oral question that we pose today is a bid from our group certainly and i am sure from all the groups to renew and refresh the debate on the roma issue
roma communities in europe continue to face unacceptable levels of prejudice and in many cases violence
however as we see from the decade of roma inclusion initiative there is a genuine feeling in this house that we want to see a comprehensive approach
however we have talked about this comprehensive approach before
there is a need in this house to reassess what we have done from the issue of micro credits to tackling racial violence and for all of these complex issues we must have a comprehensive strategy
there is a growing amount of evidence that the situation on the ground is not improving enough
the open society institute talks about prejudice and violence faced by roma communities across europe not decreasing
additionally the fundamental rights agency's discrimination survey found that the roma were discriminated against more than any other group surveyed
we owe it to this house to see that the existing legislation the race equality directive the council framework on tackling violence is actually implemented and we owe it to our comprehensive strategy as has been said earlier that we look at this as a complex problem but a problem that requires action an integrated approach a comprehensive approach
so let this oral question be a bid to refresh this debate and come up with new solutions and implement those laws which already exist which should be helping roma communities
