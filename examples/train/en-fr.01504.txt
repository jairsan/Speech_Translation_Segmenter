mr president buckfast abbey has been producing fortified wine in devon in my constituency since eighteen ninety
unfortunately this wine has now come under attack from some labour party politicians
they would rather blame one alcoholic product for an increase in antisocial behaviour than accept that their social policies have failed
buckfast wine should apparently be banned because it contains both alcohol and caffeine
if that happens what happens next
will young people be prohibited from mixing red bull with vodka
will irish coffee be banned
how will this be policed
this is the nanny state gone mad
calling for one product to be banned will not solve the problem of irresponsible drinking
we should trust consumers to enjoy whatever drinks they choose
the majority should not be punished for the actions of the ignorant few
do people honestly think that if buckfast was banned the hooligans who currently drink it to excess would start drinking tea
