mr barroso it is very good to see you here
a chance to hold the executive to account surely must be welcomed
as you know i have not always been one of your biggest supporters but i have to concede you have done very well
you have managed to ignore the french referendum result you have managed to ignore the dutch referendum result and you have managed to bully the irish into submission the second time around
so you have almost got your treaty
now of course it is time to pick the president the big global figurehead of the european union
tony blair is the odds-on favourite with the bookmakers
i just wondered whether you agree with me that his continued support for britain to join the euro his surrender of gbp two billion a year of the british rebate and his whole approach towards britain's membership of the european union his refusal to give the british a referendum all show that he has sufficient pro-european credentials to become the president
indeed was this the deal that i predicted back in two thousand and five
was this agreed all along
