i would like to recall for the presidency-in-office that at the summit meeting last december all heads of state and government agreed to a declaration which stated that in the context of an international agreement on climate change in copenhagen in two thousand and nine for those who wished to do so part of the auction revenues would be used to enable and finance actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change in developing countries which have ratified the agreement in particular the least developed countries
my question is very simple
because summit declarations do not appear in any official journal or on the record before the end of your presidency minister could you put the full content of that declaration at last december's summit on the record here in the house
it is most important that we have a record of such important declarations
