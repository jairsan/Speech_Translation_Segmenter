madam president i voted against the proposal mainly because i come from the united kingdom
i think we have good laws in place to deal with this already and we do not want the threat of rabies hitting our island
i am also rather perplexed as to why this proposal only refers to dogs cats and ferrets and i would also make the observation that a certain screaming lord sutch proposed this twenty-five years ago and he must be looking down very pleased today
but then many of my electors in the west midlands of the united kingdom will think that many of the policies coming from this house are monster raving loony policies
