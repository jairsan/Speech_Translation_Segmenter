the economic effects are obviously worse in some member states than others
thank you for talking about pensioners
my understanding is that the commission has the ability to withhold structural funds if member states are not complying with eu legislation
could the presidency undertake to investigate whether the recommendations of the auken report voted through this parliament last march have been complied with
these are regarding property owners in spain
this has had a devastating effect on european pensioners driving some of them into poverty and exclusion
