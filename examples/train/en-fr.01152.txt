taking your last question first of course i am happy to give you all my correspondence with chancellor merkel
there is no problem about that
having said this we organised two meetings before the german elections with all the countries involved with general motors opel and yesterday we organised the third one
it was the third ministerial meeting on opel organised by the commission and the first since general motors decided not to sell opel
other than being a facilitator mainly by ensuring that all stakeholders have the same information the commission will continue to ensure that internal market and state aid rules will be respected
this is very important to avoid a ruinous race to subsidies between member states which will in the end benefit no one
but the ball now is clearly in gm's court
indeed only after the gm business plan is known and our member states might be willing to provide state aid can the commission assess whether competition rules are being respected
we cannot act on suppositions
only in the face of business plans can we say whether they are or are not compatible with our community rules
