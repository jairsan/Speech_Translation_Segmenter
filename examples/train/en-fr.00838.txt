mr president the czech presidency has achieved important successes in difficult times and this record is due not least to the personal skills of prime minister topol√°nek and minister vondra who is with us today
i would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to them and thank them for their work over the last five months
undoubtedly the economic situation will dominate the june summit which will of course focus on short- and medium-term measures to get consumers spending and banks lending again
however it should also look at how the eu can assist enterprise in the longer term
for some small businesses this will mean improving access to finance and maximising their opportunities in the single market but for many the answer will simply be for politicians to cut down on red tape and interference
that is why europe cannot be allowed to go down a socialist route this june
the economic downturn has caused the socialists to show their true colours
they believe politicians should dictate how many hours you can work
they believe trade unions should prescribe your working conditions
above all they believe that they rather than the people know best
nothing epitomises the politician knows best attitude better than the recent debate over the working time directive
conservative meps were pleased last week to be able to see off the latest attempt by uk labour meps to scrap britain's opt-out to the directive
in britain three million people use the opt-out
its businesses workers and public services rely on that possibility
the czech presidency is on the side of the workers in this debate and i congratulate it for helping us to see off this latest onslaught by socialists
i urge the june council to sort out this issue once and for all and to make it quite clear that workers not politicians should choose their working time
