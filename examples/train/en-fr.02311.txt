mr president as many colleagues across this chamber have said protecting producers who have complied with this legislation and spent vast amounts of money is absolutely right and is the duty of the commission at this stage
however i do feel that there is something the commission needs to realise
i have spoken to many of my own farmers who find it difficult to find the money to invest in difficult financial and economic circumstances
i am interested in the reference to the marking or stamping of eggs
i have a recent letter from the commission which actually indicates that an additional mark would have little or no benefit because the commission did not believe that consumers would actually differentiate
therefore i would ask the commission to indicate to us whether it has changed its mind on this issue or whether it simply does not know
again i would ask the commission to indicate if it intends to go down the route of an intra-eu trade ban
i have companies in my constituency which rely on the import of eggs from other european countries
are they simply going to force these companies to rely on third-country imports
most certainly the eggs there will have been produced under much less stringent welfare systems
