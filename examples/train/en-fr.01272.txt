mr president i felt it necessary to rise on two points
mrs sommer is still in the chamber and i thought it appropriate even though she is not listening to respond to what she said
she made a series of accusations
one that i had not been transparent
can i correct the record and say that all political groups and all rapporteurs have been invited to all meetings
when they have not been able to be there their positions have been faithfully represented to those meetings
all decisions subsequently taken have been communicated to all shadow rapporteurs and all political groups
there has been a suggestion that somehow we should withdraw this motion for resolution that mrs sommer says is undemocratic and non-transparent that her group knew nothing about this
well i find this interesting when i have been negotiating this afternoon with her group the epp on their draft motion for a resolution on the oral question
so i can only think that she is misinformed and on that generous basis i look forward to negotiating sincerely and in good faith with the epp and with all other groups
finally it was remiss of me
it is the last time commissioner wallstr√∂m and i will face one another here in the chamber and i just wanted to put on record if i may that i and parliament have never doubted your commitment to openness and transparency
you have been absolutely right we have always had to fight our own corner for our own institutions and you have fought yours brilliantly but never deflecting from the principle of openness and transparency
you have been and will remain i am sure a remarkable public servant with an exemplary record
you have never flinched from doing that which you believed to be right and just and decent and on behalf of people who will never have the privilege to meet you may i say thank you
