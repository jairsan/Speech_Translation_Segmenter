madam president it is my view that sooner rather than later the irish government must seek to resolve the irish roadblock to lisbon and should do so by maintaining ireland as a full member not as a semi-detached member which opt-outs would relegate us to
we need lisbon now more than ever to strengthen europe globally and to respond effectively to citizens concerns
the financial crisis is yet another market meltdown
it has happened again because most governments bought into the fairytale that global markets could be self-regulating and failed to apply democratic controls to the market
the euro is an example of what europe can achieve when it seriously shares sovereignty
certainly if ireland had opted to keep the irish pound it would have disappeared sunk without trace by now
president barroso has admitted he got little cooperation from member states in producing a coordinated response to the crisis
he is silent however about commissioner mccreevy's continued resistance to re-regulation
commissioner mccreevy is incapable of abandoning his neo-liberal ideology and i am therefore very concerned that he is being included in the three-person body that president barroso is establishing
could i just make one final point
i propose to put mr farage's speech today in this parliament on my website because i believe the more irish people hear what he has to say about ireland and about europe the more likely they are to vote yes for the european union
