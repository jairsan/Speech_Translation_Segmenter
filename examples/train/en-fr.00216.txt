mr president the commission is greatly concerned about recent developments in east jerusalem in particular the destruction of palestinian-owned houses and the expansion of settlements in east jerusalem
at a time when confidence-building measures are urgently needed to support the negotiation process started in annapolis such measures are extremely unhelpful
the eu in its statement of eleven november called on the israeli authorities to put an early end to such measures
the eu has also on numerous occasions in recent months expressed its concern about the decision of the israeli authorities to approve the construction of new settlements in east jerusalem
the creation of facts on the ground undermines the chances for a negotiated settlement of the conflict
jerusalem is one of the so-called final-status issues to be resolved between the parties in negotiations
the commission has provided assistance to help preserve the palestinian presence in east jerusalem and is committed to continuing this support
