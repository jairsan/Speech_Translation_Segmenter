mr president thank you marco for a very good report but sadly i have to agree with other people in this house that you strayed beyond the remit and i know why
the previous speaker said that it is impossible
if we do not ask for the impossible how will we ever achieve change
but of course you have gone beyond your remit
we are not going to have broadcasts of political groups
meps putting up on their websites or through parliament's information service what they do and where they go does not mean that they are effective it does not mean they are good
the regulation is about access to all of the documents held received or produced by the three institutions when acting in its legislative capacity
that is what we need to get back to
we need to define what the legislative capacity is
we need to look at how the regulation has worked up until now and we have to improve it
that is what i want to do in conjunction with all the players and i am pleased to welcome here the swedish minister cecilia malmstr√∂m who worked originally on this
we all want to take the whole issue of access forward
why
because we recognise that many people realise that there are things that happen particularly in the council as you have illustrated whereby their ministers their national ministers are involved but how they debate and how they vote is secret
once we reveal that element of secrecy and we expose how member state ministers actually vote then those ministers are held accountable back home in their member states and suddenly national citizens feel connected to all things european
so marco you have sadly gone wider than the remit especially with this dream that you have
if you had not declared that you were an italian radical i would never have known it from this report but the fact that you expect political parties to broadcast their internal debates it is not going to happen and indeed as the previous speaker said all you do is expose division rather than reinforce the fact that we are here because we believe in a europe that is accountable to its citizens
that is why drawing up the voting list will be difficult
my heart is with you but i have to follow my head
