madam president the jailing of the journalist roxana saberi on trumped-up spying charges is shameful and another appalling crime in the long list of criminal abuse by the fascist regime in tehran
last friday as paulo casaca told us their executioners took a twenty-three year-old girl from her cell and led her to the gallows without first allowing her access to her parents
they hanged dilara darabi for a crime she denied committing at the age of seventeen
this is what passes for justice in iran
the medieval torture and execution of women even pregnant women and children is commonplace
the abuse of human rights is a daily fact of life and yet we have people in this parliament who support this corrupt and evil regime just like those european companies which continue to do business with iran their eyes and ears are closed to the screams of the oppressed
shame on them and shame on the brutal mullahs
they should remember the lessons of history every fascist regime is doomed to fail freedom and justice will always prevail over evil
