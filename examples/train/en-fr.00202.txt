madam president we are tonight talking about the single cmo on wine
we actually very much support the idea of bringing all the common market organisations together into one organisation
however we are concerned that we can identify exactly where the chapters on wine are that we can access them properly and that in the future when we are dealing with wine and member states are dealing with wine that you do not open up the whole twenty odd chapters which are included in the whole single cmo at the same time
we have now had many meetings with the commission to get reassurance on this
at the moment you are probably at the stage of bringing all these cmos together
we are seeking reassurance that we will be able to get the information we need
the industry itself of course is also concerned that it will be able to identify the rules within the single cmo
there is no doubt that the commission is telling us that this will mean a reduction in bureaucracy
we very much welcome that but we want reassurance that this is exactly the case
we have been told that the technical organisations that give information on wine to the commission will be the same as they were previously and this will now work within the single cmo so provided this is the case and that we can actually go on to a computerised system in the future and identify all the regulations we welcome this proposal
but we must be assured at the end of the day that this will actually be beneficial for the whole industry
i think there will be members tonight who will be seeking that reassurance from the commission
we look forward to the commission giving us these answers
i actually think that the way forward is to reduce bureaucracy in the commission and in europe
what we seek now is those reassurances
i welcome the single cmo
i am sure there will be other members here who have comments to make
what is absolutely apparent is that we must get this voted on now so that parliament gives its opinion and the commission can come forward and conclude this
i therefore recommend this to the house
