mr president fidel castro lies in his sick bed in his sultry caribbean island fading away and not before time
when eventually he passes there will be only two marxist systems of agriculture left in the world the collective farms of north korea and europe's common agricultural policy a policy based on price-fixing a policy based on the storage and destruction of food stocks for which there is no market a policy which wantonly passes on costs and unnecessary suffering to the third world which is deprived of its natural market
we are penalised twice over as consumers and as taxpayers by high prices and by high taxes and yet our farmers are penalised too
in my south-east region in england farming is disappearing as a meaningful part of the economy
our bluebell groves and our chestnut copses and our hop fields are gradually giving way to the spread of concrete
it has now been fifty years that our consumers and farmers have been crucified to pay for this bureaucracy
enough is enough
