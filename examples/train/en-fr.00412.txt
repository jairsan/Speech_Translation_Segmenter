madam president the two important documents we are discussing today the commission's plan of action and the report on it are separated in time by the recent interruption of gas due to the usual winter quarrel between russia and ukraine
consequently the report is more attuned to reality trying to increase our internal solidarity and expedite the implementation of the plan in front of us thus capitalising on the lessons of the last crisis
personally apart from support for the diversification of transport routes for the import of gas i consider the appeal to expedite the achievement of internal market energy in the current legislature and the necessity to revisit the entire problem of gas storage as major contributions of the report
however the recommendation to fully open the nabucco project to russia is questionable since everyone knows that nabucco was conceived as an alternative to russian gas and that consequently russia is already doing everything possible to kill it
