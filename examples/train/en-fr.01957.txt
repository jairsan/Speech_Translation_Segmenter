mr president could i first of all respond to the notion that outside interference is in some way damaging to peace processes
if one were to follow that logic the european union and indeed the world at large should turn its back on every single conflict around the world and pretend it is none of its business
that is a nonsense argument mrs dodds and i urge you to review your view on it
it is entirely legitimate for this parliament to examine potential threats to freedom of speech and freedom of association in any state with which we have a trading relationship
our treaties oblige us to engage in trade on an ethical basis
israel which has a very close trade relationship with the eu cannot be exempt from such scrutiny
i welcome the changes that have been made so far to the ngo funding bill in the knesset law committee owing no doubt to the international pressure that has been mounted but it is still only at the first stage
it still has to go back to committee and go through a second and a third stage
we do not yet know what the final version will be like
however the bill as it remains is a draconian and unbalanced bill which will discriminate in favour of private donations from foreign entities which will not have to disclose the source or purpose of such donations
either this is a bill about transparency or it is not
if it is then it has to be complete transparency
i am sceptical regarding the final outcome and believe that parliament the commission and the council must maintain their vigilance and make it clear that legislation if passed which goes beyond balanced transparency requirements will have a bearing on our relationship
i would like to comment briefly on the proposed boycott legislation which will attempt to criminalise anybody who supports a boycott of the sale in europe of goods produced illegally in the illegal settlements
i would regard that as a breach of the right to political action
