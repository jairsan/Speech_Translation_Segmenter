mr president last year this house debated the use of whole-body scanners at airports and subsequently the european commission withdrew its proposal in this regard
recently at manchester airport a new trial was started and legal advice has now been given that to use these machines on minors could be in breach of child safety and protection legislation because of the nature of the image produced
similar cases of this nature took place in two thousand and five and two thousand and six by the action on rights for children group which resulted in the banning of the use of body scanners on under eighteen year olds
since the very for these machines has now been compromised by this legal advice and i address this directly to commissioner barrot is it not now time that the commission ruled that the use of these types of scanner in the eu should not be allowed since my constituents travelling anywhere in the union should not be subject to this indecent and degrading treatment
i also call for a global ban on such technology in order to protect all eu citizens
