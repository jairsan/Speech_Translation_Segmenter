mr president it is with extreme urgency that i call on parliament to see that the eur fourteen point eight million promised to the workers in the mid-west of ireland in areas like limerick kerry and tipperary who worked for dell computers and its suppliers is allocated as soon as possible
this money was promised by the commission president under the globalisation adjustment fund in a recent visit to limerick
there is no going back on it and whatever the issues relating to protocol and how this fund is administered may be these need to be overcome immediately
parliament should not delay this money which would give the region a much-needed economic stimulus
it was estimated at one stage that dell and its suppliers employed one in every five people throughout the mid-west of ireland so this area has been hard hit
that is why i urge the commission to review the rules on state aid support
these were drawn up in two thousand and six before the massive shock that the loss of dell and the other industries created
i urge the commission to include the mid-west of ireland as an area of serious unemployment in the review of state aid rules next year so that it can qualify for the now much-needed eu funding
