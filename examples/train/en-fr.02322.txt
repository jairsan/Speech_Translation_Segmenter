mr president the commission very much welcomes this timely report as food prices are rising sharply mainly due to erratic weather conditions and natural disasters but also to increases in energy prices that impact on the cost of food
therefore i want to thank the rapporteur mrs sârbu and the members of the committee on agriculture and rural development for their efforts
food security is fundamental for the almost one billion people around the world that still suffer from hunger but it is also important for vulnerable populations across europe
for them the common agricultural policy makes a real difference
the sometimes criticised cap has managed to provide eu citizens with food at affordable prices and has ensured food security in europe
this must continue
food security is identified as a central issue in the communication on the common agricultural policy towards twenty twenty that was adopted on eighteen november by the commission
the report that mrs sârbu has put in front of us underlines the issue of excessive price volatility which is closely linked to food security because of the impact it has both on farmers and on consumers
the commission fully agrees that there is a need to tackle excessive price volatility
we must collectively look for better regulation supervision and transparency to address market issues and this requires not only better financial regulations but also substantially improved transparency on the market
the report recommends the creation of a global food system
not an easy subject
we have had experiences in the past of commodity boards
they have proved not to be successful and therefore this topic undoubtedly requires more detailed debate
it also requires analysis of the experience we have gained for example from the eur one billion food facility adopted by the commission in two thousand and eight and also from the work that the commission undertakes closely with the fao and the world food programme to ensure that bumper stocks are pre-positioned in order to soften the blow of rising food prices
all these efforts can be developed when the g twenty looks closely into the food stocks issue and you can be assured that the european commission will be an active participant in the related deliberations in the coming weeks
the report has made a call echoed by many of you here this evening for a strong agricultural and rural development policy in europe capable of ensuring food security for all with the support of research and innovation to face the challenges of producing more with the fewer resources we have and will have
the commission fully agrees with this
there is no more relevant instrument to fulfil these objectives than a strong common agricultural policy able to guarantee the economic and environmental competitiveness of agriculture and as some of you said able to bring young people into the agricultural sector of europe
