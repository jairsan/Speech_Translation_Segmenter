mr president on the motion about iran
we all share the same concern and as you mr president just said the result shows the overwhelming feeling here in this chamber right across the political spectrum
our concern is about the fact that these two ladies are not being afforded due legal process and not only that but when they try to employ lawyers the lawyers themselves are persecuted and driven away from the country
we see a government that has a complete disregard for democracy a government that ignores the results of the elections and then beats up the people and kills the protesters who want to see more democracy
we also see the persecution of people of other religions of the christian faith of the baha i faith
but i would also like to point out very quickly one other person that we should be thinking about and that is ibrahim hamidi who was accused of homosexuality
the fact that a person can be persecuted for his sexuality is a stain on the character of that country
let us hope that one day soon that regime will be overthrown
