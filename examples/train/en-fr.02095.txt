madam president i think it is important to reflect that the idea of having an ambitious programme to deal with the completion of the single market or our moves towards completion because i think that it is a job which will never ever be complete was not in the eu twenty twenty strategy
nor indeed was it in your programme when you came here for your hearing last year
i think it is a reflection of the political impetus behind the need to complete the single market and to raise its profile which was generated by president barroso's decision to ask mario monti to look at it and to ask our committee under the leadership of louis grech to look at it at the same time
we are really pleased that you have taken the initiative to move it forward
you got a flavour of some of the debates to come
i think we should reflect on this as an apt opportunity to deal with what europe desperately needs economic growth jobs a dynamic small enterprise sector more innovation more efficient public procurement those are the things that our citizens will judge us by
if we get more of them back to work and more companies started that is the biggest single social achievement that we will make with this act
