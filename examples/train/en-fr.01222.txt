mr president i am very sorry that uk domestic politics seem to have taken over here this morning
what i would like to make very clear is i am not ashamed of anything at all that the leader of the conservative party is saying or doing and in particular it is clear to all of us that we have always indicated that if the lisbon treaty had not been ratified we would have wanted it to be put to the british people
i think that is an honourable position for us to take
i think that those who talk about unreal objectives in relation to europe those who talk in an extreme and obsessive manner will do no good to the very people that i have been talking about in my speech the citizens not only of europe but the citizens of my country who want prosperity who want certainty in their lives and the future
this institutional navel-gazing occurs with these people just as much as it does with any of the institutions of europe
