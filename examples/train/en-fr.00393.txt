mr president freedom of the press is synonymous with freedom of expression and democracy
this does not of course apply in an ideal fashion in our society in which media barons as well as government and political party media interference are not unheard of but is rather prominent in some western countries not excluding the usa and some eu member states
however at least as far as legislation is concerned the media in our societies are given the theoretical protection of the law they need to function as near properly as possible
this is where we beg to differ with the kenyan government which is introducing legislative measures that can be used for possible repression and persecution of the press by the state
we therefore call on the kenyan authorities to reconsider their stance on the matter and give their mass media the legislative freedom they need in order to try at least to function as democratically as possible
the kenyan government must understand and accept that the protection of the press is essential for their country's road to betterment of living standards for its citizens
we hope and trust that the plea we have made through this resolution will not be seen as interference but as friendly advice to the government of kenya that it will be taken seriously into consideration and that there will be wiser reconsideration of what they have been doing so far
