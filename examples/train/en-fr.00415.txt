mr president i could not agree more because pre-commercial procurement serves a twofold goal
it improves the quality of public services but most of all it opens up opportunities for industry to take the lead in international markets
so it is money very well spent above all in a time of crisis when we need to help our industry to put into practice the results of research and to make the best use of technological solutions and innovations
i am very glad that the rapporteur mr harbour together with the commission has supported what has been in the pipeline for quite a long time
but there is a difference between being in the pipeline and being put into practice
i really hope that parliament's report will become a trigger and an important element to add to our research and innovation policy
indeed triggering a strong public-sector demand for the development of new innovative products and services in europe can make a difference especially for our smes and that is why i welcome the initiative
i congratulate mr harbour on his work
what are the next concrete steps we will have to take
as an immediate response to the concrete recommendations in the report i can confirm that the commission will support actions to promote the sharing of experience and awareness-raising and will explore the means to provide incentives for procurers across a number of member states in order to implement pre-commercial procurement projects jointly
the commission has already opened calls for proposals in the interreg cip and fp seven programmes to support the establishment of networks of public authorities on pre-commercial procurement
in the medium to long term i believe that governments in europe should incorporate pre-commercial procurement in their strategic planning for public investments
i think that the recovery packages would be a good place to start
on the commission side i will emphasise this in a communication planned for early march this year in which i will propose a strengthened strategy for ict research development and innovation for europe so pre-commercial procurement will be included in this report
as you know some member states have already started experimenting with pre-commercial procurement pilot projects
in the coming months we hope to see more of those and i invite the members of the committee and also the members of this house to go back to their countries and to talk to the ministers and the municipalities about pre-commercial procurement
we can only make a difference if we work together
thank you very much for giving a helping hand here
