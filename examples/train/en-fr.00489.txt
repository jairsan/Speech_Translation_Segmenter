mr president water is a key issue of cooperation across the mediterranean
so too i hope is a pan-european super-grid or hvdc interconnection including a connector between spain and the north-western coast of africa
it is of critical importance to mainstream the use of renewable energy including wind hydro various solar technologies and others
being able to rely on it at peak demand depends entirely on spreading the input into our grids from as many sources as possible so that the output can always respond to demand
if the wind is not blowing off the north-west coast of ireland and ireland has been described as the saudi arabia of europe in terms of wind energy it will be off the north-west coast of africa or the solar thermal operations in the mediterranean especially spain will be feeding the grid or the range of pv installations across the region will be inputting
this scenario is a win-win for the mediterranean region for energy security for energy politics and above all for a serious regional decrease in our carbon dioxide emissions from our current dependence on fossil fuels for industries transport and heating and cooling
