the commission is aware of the issues raised in relation to canada's intellectual property rights protection and enforcement
we are extremely concerned that canada's proposed reform of its copyright act appears to be being given so little priority
reasonable protection of intellectual property rights is essential for the future survival of the creative industries
while several member states are now eagerly discussing how intellectual property rights can better be adapted to the online world we must indeed still pay attention to the risks of internet piracy originating from third countries
one of the key issues in play is how to strike a fair balance between the interests of rights holders and those of consumers while respecting data protection rules
you will remember that this was a key debating point of the commission creative content online initiative launched by the communication of three january two thousand and eight
the commission's concerns have been put forcefully to the canadian authorities for quite some time now
the fact we will soon start negotiations for a free trade agreement with canada will give us a new opportunity to bring about significant improvement of ipr protection in canada
in the mean time the commission will be taking the matter up with the canadian authorities at the highest level
it will also call for the revision of canadian copyright law to be initiated as soon as possible and preferably during the parliament's present session
