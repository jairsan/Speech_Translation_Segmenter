mr president pre-lisbon post-lisbon we have very little to be proud of
in europe you can still be discriminated against if you are a woman
we have heard it said here in the chamber today a woman cannot choose what to do with her body
you can be discriminated against on the grounds of age disability religion belief sexual orientation
on the supply of goods and services there is no movement on the council directive
if you are in a same-sex partnership or a civil partnership or a marriage you can be discriminated against by a member state on the precept of the concept of subsidiarity
on that basis you can promote inequality
we have a two-speed europe where some people are equal and others are not
we sit here and do nothing while we see rising xenophobia racism anti-semitism homophobia and transphobia and yes look at what is happening to the roma
have we learnt nothing from the second world war
have we learnt nothing from the nineteen thirties when we turned away and did nothing because people were different from us
can we not see that religion decent religion is being used as an excuse to increase discrimination against lgbt people in particular
can we not see that to diminish the rights of another is ultimately to diminish our own
we have nothing to be proud of
