i will be bringing it up with the group leaders because i am sorry to say that is where the problem lies in the conference of presidents when they set the agenda
it is a question of too much material being put on the agenda before we get to question time
you are right
there needs to be some sort of line drawn to make sure that this period of time when members can hold the commission or the council to account is honoured
i agree with you and i will be tapping away at my computer first thing tomorrow morning i assure you
