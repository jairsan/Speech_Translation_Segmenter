mr president we have three great challenges in this area security of energy supply the inefficiency of our internal market in energy and the imperative of combating climate change
desertec and nabucco are central to meeting these challenges
if we succeed in developing high-voltage solar thermal power in north africa we can give a sense of purpose to the union for the mediterranean we can assist in water provisioning in the countries on the southern mediterranean rim and we can develop electricity generation technology for which there is a massive world market
if we can convince member states of the political need for greater energy independence and stop berlin and paris from undercutting it at every turn nabucco can help us diversify our supply of oil and gas
the motion for a resolution before us today says little about what we need to do here in the european union
we need to develop renewable energy production solar thermal and other
we need to build high-voltage dc electricity distribution capacity through a smart grid some eur fifty billion of investment but creating many jobs and we need oil and gas storage facilities and even more a storage policy to reduce our dangerous dependence on russia
our energy provision will continue to rely on oil and nuclear power but as we prepare for the world climate change conference in copenhagen the only big idea is the switch to renewables
wind could meet all the new electricity demand in china in the next twenty years and replace twenty-three of their coal generation
deserts get more energy from the sun in six hours than humankind uses in a year
commissioner you said this is not part of our strategy for security of energy supply
well it should be and it must be
