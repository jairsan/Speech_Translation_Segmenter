i just want to say to the vice-president of the commission that we should look at the situation in denmark where they are now talking about applying for membership of the euro in iceland where the country has been torn apart and in sweden where clearly they are looking again at joining the euro
for example who is telling the people of ireland that because they were under the euro and the european central bank they have been able to weather this storm much better than these other countries
is it not time that we actually start talking up the european union
this week we have members of the european parliament from ireland in this house making negative comments about the european union
who is going to make the positive comments and claim the good things for us so that people know the benefits of being in the european union and the euro
