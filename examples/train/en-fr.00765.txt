throughout the past year the commission has recognised that marine science and technology is a cross-cutting priority area
this culminated in the adoption by the commission in september two thousand and eight of the communication on a european union strategy for marine and maritime research
the strategy seeks in particular to foster integration across thematic priorities to address complex sea-related issues boost synergies between member states research efforts promote the financing of financial marine research infrastructure and build new governance with the marine and maritime scientific communities particularly through increased cooperation between marine science and maritime industries
the following actions have already been implemented in the framework of the strategy
first joint calls for proposals are being prepared and should be launched later this year to address major cross-thematic marine and maritime issues
second steps have been taken to upgrade the bonus programme into a major community research initiative under article one hundred and sixty-nine of the treaty one of the questions later on is also related to this issue
third steps have been taken to progressively replace all existing marine era-nets with one integrated marine era-net
fourth steps have been taken to explore new sources of financing critical marine research infrastructures particularly through the structural funds
finally two projects will be financed to foster cooperation between marine science and maritime industries as well as a stronger integration between the different actors within the marine scientific community
the implementation of the european union strategy for marine and maritime research under the current financial perspective will ensure the promotion in the coming years of marine and maritime research at community level through the framework programme instruments
the broadening of prospects for careers related to the sea cluster which is also part of your question is not directly an objective of the research policy
however by stimulating cooperation between marine scientists and maritime industries as well as more integrated marine and maritime research the european union strategy for marine and maritime research can indirectly broaden the scope of maritime skills and promote marine clusters
it can in this way indirectly contribute to the upgrading of qualifications and skills associated with the maritime professions
finally in the broader framework of your question and my reply in the european economic recovery plan last autumn the commission proposed to member states and the private sector to increase planned investments in r d this was followed up by the spring european council conclusions which have sent a strong message on the need for stepping up and improving the quality of investment in knowledge and research for economic recovery
of course this is also very valid for marine and maritime research
it is still premature for any assessment on how and if the member states will follow these recommendations
one thing however remains clear even in the current difficult economic and financial circumstances we should not lose sight of long-term objectives such as sustainable development and the low-carbon economy
it is thus important to focus on so-called smart investments which at the same time look at overcoming the crisis in the short term and at long-term possibilities and how strong we will be when we come out of the crisis
