mr president in yesterday's votes we discussed the issue of migration
one of the issues that should have been discussed concerning migration is how do we make it less attractive for people to leave their own country or more attractive to stay in their own country and why do they seek to leave their country often breaking family and other local emotional ties
one of the things we have to look at is the impact of our policies in the eu
when we sign these fishing agreements often with governments of countries and they benefit from this do these agreements really benefit local fishermen
surely we should be re-examining all these fisheries agreements and instead of signing fisheries agreements we should perhaps be increasing the fishing capacity of local fishermen to spread wealth and create more jobs locally so that people want to stay in their own countries rather than seek to leave
if we do not think carefully about the implications of some of these agreements we will see more demand for migration and will end up debating migration rather than the issues we are debating here
