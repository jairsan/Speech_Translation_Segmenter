mr president it is self-evident that foreign and security policy is the defining role of a sovereign state
to make it the role of a supranational authority ignores or devalues the vital question of relations between member states or is in fact an admission that they are no longer sovereign states
there is nothing wrong with an eu policy of avoiding all european wars but i would reject the supposition that a surrender of sovereignty is necessary to achieve that
it should also be the function of every european state to defend europe's great achievements from distraction or dilution
aggressive wars in which european nations have no legitimate interest must be avoided at all costs
equally we must not engage in behind-the-scenes agitation in a hypocritical attempt to plant so-called european values in inhospitable soil
we must avoid europe being the repository of migrating third-worlders
their cultures are the product of distinctive peoples
bring the population of the third world to europe
