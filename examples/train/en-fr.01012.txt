mr president i welcome the text put forward today by the various political groups and the earlier statement by the commissioner particularly the recognition of the need to diversify our energy technology and to secure our supply
but of course there is no one answer to ensuring our supply
all technologies must be considered
there has to be a mix including ccs and of course where i come from is wales which still has a plentiful supply of coal
energy efficiency must also be improved
that is why i believe we should be spending more of european structural funds on energy efficiency measures to save energy but also to boost the economy
i would also like to make two further quick points
firstly on desertec which i believe is an exciting project but we have to recognise that it is a long-term project
it is not a quick fix
secondly the storage of gas reserves is important but again we need to recognise that it is expensive and funding will be required
so i support all the texts put forward today particularly by the s d group but these are important points and i would welcome the views of the commissioner on those points
