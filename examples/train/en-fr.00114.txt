mr president i voted against the joint motion on the european council summit because of its duplicity over the irish referendum and its foolish clinging to economically damaging climate-change targets
the communiqu√© makes a hypocritical affirmation of respect for the irish rejection of lisbon and then immediately sets about insisting through the coded language of these documents that the irish fall into line
the so-called respect for the democratic decision of the voters is patently false
now here we all are facing a deep economic crisis the worst most of us can remember and the eu is worried about keeping the deck chairs of climate targets in place
industry and our economies cannot now afford this ever-higher green taxation burden
all we will succeed in doing is expelling more and more of our manufacturing industry to the far east
