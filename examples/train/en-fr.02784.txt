mr president we in the ecr group want to see more effective control of the eu budget
on behalf of taxpayers we demand real added value for money spent at eu level
especially in these times of economic stringency we want a tougher attitude towards spending in general not more spending but better spending
applying this logic in the committee on employment and social affairs i am questioning the efficiency of the four agencies which we have been discussing eurofund etf osha and the improbably named cedefop
i recently myself visited etf in turin and also heard a presentation from cedefop while i was there
there is indeed as earlier speakers have said considerable overlap between their programmes and i believe that their management and administration at least could usefully be merged
i am therefore asking the following questions
does the commission apply efficiency and performance criteria to these agencies
if so may we see the criteria
secondly how do the agencies perform against the criteria
can the commission show parliament an analysis of the agencies performance
thirdly given the considerable functional overlap has the commission considered merging them
we have heard about synergies we want to see them
who sets the objectives and strategy of the agencies
may we see them
more generally there seems to be considerable overlap between reports on employment matters produced on these agencies by the commission and by the policy department of the european parliament
we ask is this duplication worthwhile
