madam president a young woman in my constituency has this morning as every weekday morning at this time just returned home from walking her two young children to school
jenny used to drive them there but she can no longer afford to put petrol in the car for anything other than her twice-weekly trip to the cheapest supermarket in her part of manchester
this morning as every morning jenny is hungry because she has a choice for breakfast either she eats or her two little girls eat
there is not enough bread and jam for all of them
meanwhile here on planet eu meps discuss tweaks to a financial instrument that involves the spending of eur one point one billion of taxpayers money on promoting democracy and human rights mainly in the third world
most of those tweaks further reduce the oversight the nation states have as the commission burns its way through vast amounts of british taxpayers money
what a waste and what hypocrisy to bang on about women's rights in africa when thousands of jennies cannot even feed their kids properly
