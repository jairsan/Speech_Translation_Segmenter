mr president i have no doubt that you will try to cut me off as usual when it comes to freedom of speech but i really want to talk about the hazardous substances and toxicity
i think we all agree and as a former electronic engineer i know about the level of hazardous and toxic substances within this equipment
it is absolutely right that we are trying to tackle this issue
but i would also like to talk about the toxicity that has permeated the debate and democracy here in the european parliament today
surely when a german national a socialist talks
