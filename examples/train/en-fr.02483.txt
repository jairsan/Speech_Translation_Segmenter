madam president whilst food prices are undoubtedly rising the situation at the farm gate is very different
british farmers producing beef sheep meat pig meat and eggs have actually seen a drop in the value of their produce over the last year poultry meat is unchanged and milk only marginally higher sugar beet will fall next year
these businesses are facing huge cost increases themselves and cannot sustain the status quo for more than a few months
then they will either succeed in claiming higher prices from the retailers or they will cease production
either way retail food prices can only go higher
what is the eu doing about this
well it is making it unnecessarily expensive to import non-gm soya beans
it is charging farmers a global warming levy on their electricity bills whilst those same farmers have lost thousands of tons of sugar beet and potatoes in the ground due to very cold weather
the eu wants to increase the public subsidy to organic farming rather than allowing this sector to be consumer-led
any switching of conventional production systems to organic will lead to a reduction in food supplies
