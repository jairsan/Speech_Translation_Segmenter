madam president the promotion of a sustainable workforce for health across europe is crucial in continuing our improvement in healthcare services and facilities across the twenty-seven member states
europe faces a number of challenges in sustaining and improving our healthcare services
the demography of the member states poses a major issue for health workers as europe's population ages and life expectancy increases by two point five years every decade
increased pressures apply to the workforce because as the population ages so too do the workers
the key to maintaining an adequate workforce in the face of this imminent retirement is to ensure that there are sufficient younger recruits available to replace those who retire
the importance of improved healthcare research and data across europe cannot be stressed enough
at present there is a lack of up-to-date comparable data and information among the member states on a number of key healthcare issues including training and employment of workers age gender and international flow of health professionals
the availability of europe-wide information is immensely important for the planning and provision of future health workers and for all health authorities
