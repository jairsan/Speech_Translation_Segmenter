mr president the june two thousand and nine council recommended prioritising the conclusion of readmission agreements with libya and turkey considered as major gates for illegal immigration into europe
the libyan gate mainly affects malta and italy
massive illegal immigration in malta risks altering its demographic composition
although shared responsibility is recognised by all little is done in practice to correct this development
the number of arrivals in malta decreased only when italy equally affected reached a bilateral agreement with libya in which libya assumed responsibility for patrolling its shores and harbours
what is needed is an eu-libya readmission agreement in the context of a framework agreement
negotiations are difficult but we support the commission's efforts and we encourage it to continue until it succeeds
we commend the migration and cooperation agreement concluded between the commission and libya last october
it is essential to prepare libya with regard to issues such as the protection system for asylum seekers the management of land borders the alignment of legislation with the african convention on refugees and the management of migratory flows
we know about the human rights situation the dependent judiciary the conditions of detention torture and capital punishment in libya
however the readmission agreement is necessary
this excludes people who are entitled to asylum need political protection or risk mistreatment in libya while the principle of non-refoulement applies to everybody
