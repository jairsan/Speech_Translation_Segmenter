mr president the aim of this regulation is to protect public health and the environment
the current regime for authorisation is too slow and bureaucratic
we must ensure that the authorisation of new products is more efficient both in time and money
pest control is central to the protection of human health
i welcome the amendments that will improve the availability of some products that kill rodents but as has already been discussed a problem remains over the treatment of difenacoum
this is an effective and widely used rodenticide
it should be classified as an authorised substance
it is essential to the effective control of rats and mice
its removal from annex i by the commission is simply irrational and i invite the commission to explain why this occurred
the authorisation of products should always be based on the result of scientific assessment not by politicians seeking to grab a headline
