mr president given small businesses importance in the economy for employment and job creation enterprise and wealth creation innovation new products and new services now is a very good time for us to do something to boost their efforts in difficult times
there is a tendency at eu level to wax enthusiastic about smes potential and performance
indeed it would be rather difficult to be negative
however the thrust of this question and the motion for a resolution is that we must go beyond rhetoric and deliver concrete action
one of the priorities identified is the need for improved access to finance for smes
this is a perennial cry for the problem is long-standing
yet now in the financial crisis when a seizure of credit is hitting all business it must surely be worse for smes which tend to be at the end of the food chain as far as orders and payments are concerned
so i strongly support the call for making finance and credit more available
the question is whether the banks will respond
based upon my own experience of working in and then running a small business it is very difficult to define forms of assistance and support that can help all smes because they are so varied
i feel that the best sort of help is access to information and i believe that the internet has made a huge change in that respect from my time in business
the next best thing is to be left alone to get on with the business
so while i recognise that it is not possible to have no regulation i also support the priority of better regulation not least because that is something that legislators and governments can do
i support the call for action from both the commission and the member states
