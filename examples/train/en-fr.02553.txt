madam president it was the trotskyists who transformed marxist class warfare into multi-grievance group warfare
society was to be segmented into groups who might or might not have known that they had a grievance until that was explained to them by helpful young militants
the groups might be defined by ethnicity religion sex sexuality age or disability
they were all to be urged to engage in collective action against their oppressors
the trotskyists grew older if not up
in some cases they moved into positions of power and influence
their ideas spread much faster and further than they did
the word discrimination when followed by the word against became the ultimate evil
in many cases there is no identifiable perpetrator
the discriminator is the rest of society
we are all guilty
people whatever their real disadvantage must realise when they are being manipulated and must shake off that manipulation
