regarding the situation of greece we believe that greece has taken the necessary steps to reduce the government deficit this year
these measures show the determination of the greek government to tackle their structural problems
at the same time we are doing what is required to secure the financial stability of the euro area as a whole
the commission has been actively working with euro area member states to design a mechanism which greece could use in case of need
such a mechanism would conform with the current lisbon treaty in particular with the no bail-out clause
it would include stringent conditionality
the commission is ready to propose a european framework for coordinated assistance which would require the support of euro area member states
this is what i can tell you about greece and about our response for euro area stability
regarding the eu twenty twenty proposals we do not see any need to change them
we have put those proposals forward
they are now going to be discussed by the european council and parliament and we hope this will be a very fruitful discussion
