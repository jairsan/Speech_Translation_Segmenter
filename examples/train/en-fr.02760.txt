mr president while you are enjoying yourself with your jokey and unorthodox approach to dealing with requests from the floor for check votes may i humbly submit that if you were to go a little slower the interpretation could keep up with your announcements and we could then vote in a more timely fashion
you are going a little fast and there is a little delay
