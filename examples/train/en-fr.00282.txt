madam president i would like to wish you merry christmas as well
you are not in a completely empty chamber
i voted for the l√≥pez report on the protection of adults especially with cross-border implications because i know from experience the necessity of this but also because i hope this is going to be one step closer to the day when we can see true mobility in europe
in this we are dealing with adults who in some way are attached to a court situation
in many cases these are often very vulnerable people and in some cases they are wards of court or people with disabilities
but if we can take this further the logic of this would be to get one step closer to the day when social welfare recipients can bring their supports with them so that they too can move around europe the way employees do
