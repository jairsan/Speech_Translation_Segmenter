madam president how many recognitions are necessary for a state to be independent
this is not the question since the quality of the recognitions matters more than the quantity
a declaration of self-determination does not lead to independence if the state in question is not recognised by those from which it wants to self-determine
the independence of a state is not real as long as the united nations security council does not accept it
moreover a state is not independent if it is not able to offer to all communities living on its territory a fair prospect of organic integration into a civic and multicultural society and if it is not self-sustainable and self-governable
for all these reasons the athisaari plan failed
asking for the is not a solution either one should move further
to this end the european union and the permanent members of the united nations security council must convene an international conference which should find a sustainable solution for democratic security geo-strategic equilibrium and social economic stability in the western balkans
within this framework kosovo should be put back on the track of international legality and the region should receive a clear road map for its eu integration
unfortunately the lagendijk report does not explore such ways thus abandoning any realistic drive towards a better future
therefore romanian social democrats will be obliged to vote against this report
