madam president the action plan for the eu-africa strategic partnership includes a section on democratic governance and human rights which are regarded as key for sustainable development
however we have been very poor at implementing such objectives
a prime example has been the failure to bring about real change in zimbabwe
in two thousand and seven in the lead-up to the first eu-africa summit we complained bitterly about the eu's hypocrisy in imposing a travel ban and asset freeze on mugabe and his ilk with one hand while inviting him to a summit in a european capital lisbon with the other
now we find that mugabe is yet again invited to an eu-africa summit albeit in libya and we meekly trot along as if none of this mattered
to rub shoulders with mugabe is an affront to our principles and is in direct contradiction to the eu's own stated position
it is a failure of our diplomacy in africa that any african government still has any regard for mugabe
madam president may i put two questions to the council and the commission
in libya will eu representatives voice their disapproval of mugabe's presence
secondly what is the eu doing to actively promote good governance
without it there is little hope for a prosperous democratic future for africa
