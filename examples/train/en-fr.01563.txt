mr president i supported the resolution on the situation of civil society and national minorities in belarus and today i would like to express once again my great concern at the recent human rights violations in belarus against members of civil society and against members of the national minorities and their organisations
i would like to declare my full solidarity with citizens unable to enjoy their full civil rights
i would also like to strongly condemn the arrest of angelika borys the chairperson of the union of poles in belarus and also anatoly lebedko the leader of the opposition united civil party and the leader of the united democratic forces in belarus who has been the guest of this house on several occasions
regrettably the people of belarus are not able to benefit from many projects and proposals the european union is financing as part of our eastern neighbourhood policy
