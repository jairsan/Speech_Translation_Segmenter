mr president israel states it is exercising its right to self-defence
in that case the rudiments of the just war principles including proportionality must be adhered to
the fact that israel is ignoring this is patently clear and for us to ignore this fact is patently wrong
the use of phosphorus on civilians with the claim of civilisation is not compatible
clearly the eu alone cannot resolve this
but there is a white elephant in the room
we need the resolve of the usa
their disappointing response has been imbalanced and unjust
the timing of these actions by israel has been strategically calculated but mr obama twenty january is fast approaching
the world is waiting and the eu is a willing partner will you restore those values we share with you or will you allow such injustice to prevail yet again
will you work with us to provide protection for all concerned
the palestinians ask you how can it be right that your country asks for humanitarian aid on the ground but remains silent when there are only bombs from the skies
colleagues wanting to break hamas with military means alone go and see gaza and the west bank
reawaken your basic humanity and you will see why hamas gains strength
this is not the way to help israel or palestinians
an immediate ceasefire is only a necessary start
