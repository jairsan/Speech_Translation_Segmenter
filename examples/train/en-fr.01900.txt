madam president the committee on the internal market and consumer protection adopted an opinion analysing the problems of the food supply chain as a whole
we recommended that farmers should be encouraged to be more efficient and to consolidate their negotiating power and that ombudsmen should be established in all member states to arbitrate disputes in the supply chain ensuring that competition between all actors in the supply chain is rigorous but fair so as to secure the lowest possible food prices for consumers while also recognising the valuable role that retailers own brand labels play in enhancing competition and providing choice and lower prices to consumers
i am disappointed that mr bov√© and the committee on agriculture took little notice of these suggestions
they may not like it but markets work and the freer the market the better it works to the benefit of all especially the consumer
i have to urge all members to vote against this resolution and to support the alternative ecr resolution
