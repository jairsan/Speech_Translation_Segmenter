mr president i voted for the epp resolution because the text of this resolution offered a constructive and comprehensive european solution to the problem of better social inclusion of roma
instead of using their serious social and economic situation as an instrument for politically motivated attacks against certain law-abiding governments like those of france and italy the epp proposes a european roma strategy
shifting the problem from one member state to another does not help us to find necessary resources
we can only do it together in the spirit of a constructive approach
