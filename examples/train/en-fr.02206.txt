well mr barroso i enjoyed that enormously that you can stand up and boast about the fact that you were elected in secret and that somehow this gives you democratic legitimacy is the most bizarre concept i have come across in my entire life
the fact is that the commission has the sole right to propose the kind of legislation that is damaging europe's economies in the way that it is
are there any circumstances in which you think the peoples of europe should have a referendum so that they can decide these issues
