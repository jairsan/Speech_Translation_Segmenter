madam president i think this debate is a timely one and that mrs neyts-uyttebroeck's report includes a number of important recommendations
it gives me the opportunity to raise an issue which is central to our policy towards the western balkans
the work of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty is an essential element in rendering justice coming to terms with the past and moving forward
it is also key to strengthening the rule of law in the region
this can be a slow and at times difficult process but the icty has made important progress
so far it has completed proceedings against one hundred and sixteen accused with very different verdicts
only two of one hundred and sixty-one indictees remain at large
when the icty was set up in nineteen ninety-three the domestic judicial systems in the former yugoslavia were unprepared for dealing with crimes of this scale
yet it was clear that they had to be addressed
no contract no agreement no society can be sustainable without justice
our strategy towards the region is to assist in stabilising the countries of the western balkans and helping them realise their eu perspective
a central element of that policy is cooperation with the icty
we support its mandate in several ways
firstly the countries of the western balkans are part of the stabilisation and association process sap
this process depends on respect for democratic principles the rule of law human rights and the rights of persons belonging to minorities fundamental freedoms and the principles of international law and regional cooperation
it also depends on full cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia
sap conditionality is monitored through the annual progress reports prepared by the commission
the next progress reports will be published in october two thousand and nine
in addition human rights and rule-of-law issues including strengthening the functioning impartiality and responsibility of the judiciary system and the fight against corruption and organised crime are key priorities of the eu's european partnership with the countries of the western balkans
these are updated on a regular basis
furthermore the council has adopted two common positions aimed at supporting the implementation of the mandate of the icty by imposing an assets freeze on indicted fugitives and a travel ban on persons assisting icty indictees to evade justice
these common positions are regularly extended and updated
the european union will support the work of the icty until it has been completed
i entirely agree that in the longer term the legacy of the icty must be preserved
whenever this happens and it is not a matter for the eu to decide the domestic judicial systems will need to be ready to take over the icty's files
this is one of the reasons why the emphasis we have placed on judicial reform and good governance in the sap is so important
the work of ngos and individuals such as the humanitarian law centre in belgrade and the research and documentation centre in sarajevo who are seeking the truth also deserves our full support
let me close by thanking this parliament for your support in this area and in particular for this helpful and constructive report
