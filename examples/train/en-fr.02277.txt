madam president i cannot understand why the socialists are trying to escape from the responsibility of socialist policies
it is true that the reasons for the deficits we see in europe are different
it is also true that socialist governments have entered into budget deficit problems because of a deliberate policy of increased spending and increased deficits
we had this debate in parliament in the spring of two thousand and nine and we had it in a number of member states
i remember the swedish social democrats criticised the swedish government for not increasing the deficit and the spending
then we have seen what has happened
this is for me a reason why we need stable rules regarding the stability and growth pact but also stable rules regarding the consequences
we cannot have a situation where member states which are causing problems for financial systems and causing increased interest rates are allowed to escape from the consequences by letting other citizens pay for those interest rates
we need to have stability and eurobonds will not be a solution to that problem
we can have eurobonds for other reasons
maybe
as for the financial mechanism it must be financed and based upon the risks that member states are creating
if you take a bigger risk run a bigger deficit then you also need to finance the financial mechanism a little bit more
that is a way of taking responsibility for deliberate policies
do not forget that the consequences we see in a number of countries are the consequences of the debates we had in national parliaments and in this parliament when some of us argued for increased spending
now we see the bitter results
