mr president i will be brief to compensate for the time that mr portas took
many members in this chamber will congratulate themselves on having obtained a two point nine increase for the eu budget twenty eleven
others instead will complain that this is not enough
i for one deplore the fact that this parliament ignores the crisis that europeans are going through and only looks to satisfy its own ambitions
i for one regret that mr cameron approves such an increase while imposing severe cuts in the british budget a situation that has started to generate civil unrest
this money is not going to improve the economy of those member states nor is it going to provide jobs for those who are losing them but if kept in britain it would avoid the need to increase the tuition fees for example
of course we will not vote in favour of this budget as increased
