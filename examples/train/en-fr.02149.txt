madam president i want to give my support to resolution thirteen twenty-five
i turn the house's attention to the situation in northern ireland where we have a very active women's sector a sector that has been a force for good within the country
before coming to this house i represented west belfast in the northern ireland assembly and the shankill area of belfast in local government
these are areas that have been ravaged by over thirty years of violence inflicted through a terrorist campaign by irish republicans and intra-community violence
throughout that time groups like the women's centre have been a cohesive force enhancing community capacity and forging links with other women's groups in other communities
they are ordinary women who have proved themselves to be leaders and an excellent role model for other countries and communities that find themselves faced with terrorism and violence
today groups like the shankill women's centre the foyle women's network and training for women are not only forging the way ahead in community relations in northern ireland but are also giving women opportunities in the labour market through education and training
this is the way forward colleagues
