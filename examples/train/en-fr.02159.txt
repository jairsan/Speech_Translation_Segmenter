mr president perhaps you would allow me to make the general point that in an open society the right to free speech trumps the right not to be offended and in a democracy the only people who should determine whether or not we sit and legislate in a chamber are our constituents
the removal of a member can materially affect the outcome
now if we are going to be disinterested in our application of the rules then we ought to censure obnoxious allusions whichever side they come from but i think there is something arbitrary and unfair about allowing eurosceptics to be called nazis
