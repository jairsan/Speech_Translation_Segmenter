madam president first of all we take note of the report just given to us on the independent fact-finding mission
it is very difficult in circumstances like these to say who started things and who followed
what is important is that the facts remain on the ground a year after this conflict and that they violate a number of principles which the european union has to support
first as you said mr commissioner there is the principle of support for the territorial integrity of georgia
all our diplomatic and other actions should never encourage udis or separatisms
faits accomplis created by the use of force are not acceptable and can never be acceptable
secondly there is the right of displaced persons to return to their homes and properties the basic freedom of movement as you said to cross the dividing lines
ownership of property and settlement should be at the centre of our policies and initiatives need to be undertaken to address these humanitarian and human rights issues independently of the outcome of any political settlement
thirdly the hostilities in south ossetia have proven that there is no such thing as a frozen conflict
the term frozen has a notion of appeasement
a lack of interest on the part of the international community may lead to chronicity and an unsettled conflict is a potential threat to peace and stability
one year after the conflict i underline once more the successful role of the european union and the french presidency in achieving a speedy ceasefire and the mission which monitors it
the presence of european monitors is a guarantee that no side can claim from now on arbitrarily that the other has started hostilities
efforts now should be diverted towards a political settlement however difficult this is and the political negotiations launched in geneva immediately after the hostilities should be encouraged to continue
we support the efforts for a new association agreement under the framework of the eastern partnership which goes beyond opportunities for trade and investment
we also support an agreement to facilitate the procedures for issuing short-stay visas and on readmission between the european community and georgia and we are satisfied with the post-conflict assistance package which is operating well
