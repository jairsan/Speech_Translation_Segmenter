the commission is currently still engaged in negotiations with the united states and we are very optimistic that a mutually acceptable solution can emerge very soon
in the last few weeks we had intensive transatlantic contacts on this issue
the eu trade commissioner catherine ashton and us trade representative ron kirk agreed on twenty-two april to hold further talks in order to find a negotiated solution to the long-running dispute over hormone-treated beef
they confirmed their wish to resolve this difficult issue that affects businesses and consumers in both the eu and the us and in order to facilitate the negotiations for a solution commissioner ashton and us trade representative kirk agreed that the imposition of the so-called carousel <unk> by the us on certain eu products would be postponed by a further two weeks beyond the original twenty-three april deadline
the commission is committed to doing its best to find a positive and lasting solution to this issue and talks are currently being held by senior officials from both sides
the commission's final objectives in these negotiations are to definitively prevent activation of the carousel <unk> and to have the retaliatory measures currently in place revoked
we are confident that an agreement is within reach that would fully safeguard our public health and consumer protection objectives in this issue
