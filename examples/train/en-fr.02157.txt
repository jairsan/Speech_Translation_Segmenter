mr president the restriction and in some case the prescribing of alternative medicines herbal remedies higher-dose vitamin and mineral supplements has been one of great scandals of european regulation
i have no idea what the efficacy of these cures is
my wife swears by them i am a little bit more sceptical but as king solomon wisely says it is better to have a dish of bitter herbs in a house where there is love than a stalled ox and hatred therewith
rarely could the proverb about the bitter herbs have applied quite so aptly as in this case
but whether they are useless or whether they are helpful they are certainly not deleterious to health
so why did the european union criminalise an activity harmlessly pursued by some twenty million europeans
answer lobbying by some large pharmaceutical corporations which saw the opportunity to put small herbalists out of business something that has now happened all over my constituency
they could never have got these rules through the national parliaments
once again we see the way in which the brussels machinery has become a racket open to the big corporations
