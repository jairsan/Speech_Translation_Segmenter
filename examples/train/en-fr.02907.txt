madam president certain member states have jumped the gun on stress tests
as we have heard the uk nuclear inspector dr mike weightman published his interim report even before the stress tests had been agreed
will the commission insist that all member states conduct the stress tests properly and do not do their own lightweight version
i am particularly concerned that the uk government might go ahead with approving a whole new generation of nuclear power stations before the stress test procedure is concluded in june next year
commissioner do you agree that this would be unwise in terms of european nuclear safety
will you make sure that information which cannot be disclosed publicly due to security concerns is at least shared in a secure forum such as between national security services
