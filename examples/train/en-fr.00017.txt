madam president i have to admit to the commissioner that i am really quite confused by what has been going on with this case
i had heard nothing about it until literally this week and suddenly i get deluged with approaches both from the iascf and from the commission trying to persuade me one way or the other as to whether the imf should be included in the monitoring group
i think this is a rather unsatisfactory way to proceed with what is essentially almost a piece of legislation so i would ask the commissioner if we could not delay this a little get it sorted out and come back to it perhaps at the october mini-plenary
i would like to suggest that i do not see that adding the imf and the world bank to this monitoring group would make it that unwieldy
it seems to me they would cover the rest of the world in a rather satisfactory manner
i do not really see that there is a need then to have yet another accounting advisory group that advises the monitors that monitor things
it is like the house that jack built
i wonder whether they could not in any case consult quite readily unofficially if they ever need to do so
i wonder if we could have some discussions over the next couple of weeks and end up with a vote possibly in a more satisfactory manner at the mini-plenary in october
