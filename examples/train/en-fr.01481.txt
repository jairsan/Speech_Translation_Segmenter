mr president my thanks to the spanish presidency and to the commission for their words on this situation
i think we need to be clear about one thing what we are talking about now is not a single incident it is the actions of a dictatorship and a brutal regime that is denying minority rights as well as the rights of its individual citizens
that is how things are in belarus and i think that must be the point of departure for our discussions on the dialogue with the regime
a dialogue must be mutual
when we show openness we need to require the regime in belarus to deliver and they have not delivered the changes and the reforms that they should deliver
i would like to say and underline very much that this is not a polish issue
belarus is in the neighbourhood of the european union
it is included in the eastern partnership
this is a european issue and by its actions now the regime in belarus is distancing itself from open dialogue and cooperation with the european union
we shall require first of all in a fundamental way respect for minorities respect for human rights a stop to police brutality and a willingness to have a constructive dialogue with the european union
i think this message must be made clear to the regime
our dialogue must be a dialogue for democracy and human rights and of course we should turn to civil society because belarus is much more than the regime
it is the people living in belarus the students men and women society
i think what we have seen lately has proved that we must now proceed with a dialogue directed at civil society in order to strengthen freedom and democracy and respect for human rights
