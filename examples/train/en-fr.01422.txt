mr president like my colleagues here i have been hugely frustrated and angered by the council's treatment of and substandard consultation with this house on the agreement
parliamentary consultation and consent should not be a retrospective tool
the reciprocity of data protection should be beyond reproach and the manner in which the agreement has been negotiated and concluded must never be repeated
however i have been reassured at least by the united states authorities and by the multi-layered data protection systems and judicial safeguards that are in place through this interim agreement
so our poor treatment by the council should not compromise the eu's agreement with the united states or any future agreements on the security of europe
we are now receiving loads of assurances and promises from the council and from the commission
i cannot yet judge whether these answer all the reasonable requirements we have laid down so in my opinion we now need some time before proceeding further with our consideration of this vital measure
