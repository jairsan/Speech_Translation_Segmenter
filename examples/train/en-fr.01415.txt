mr president when we listen to the discussion here in parliament there are many colleagues here who lament the fact that the eu was not listened to in the recent discussions in copenhagen
maybe we should consider why that was
let us look at our own behaviour here in this european parliament
for a start we have two european parliament buildings
we come to strasbourg and we keep this building heated and lit when we are not here gross hypocrisy
let us look at the expenses regime an expenses regime that encourages meps to take taxis and chauffeured cars but if you try to take public transport you are not allowed to claim that back hypocrisy
if you look at parliament buildings at night you see that they keep their lights on and are well lit
look at the common agricultural policy which many meps in this place support that not only damages developing countries economies but damages the environment
so before we preach to the rest of the world it is time we got our own house in order
