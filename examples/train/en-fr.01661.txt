in march the european commission announced it would conduct another review of the working time directive after the previous review fell
it was parliament's insistence on scrapping the national opt-outs from the directive which led to the stalemate
as we will all recall uk labour meps in the pockets of their trade unions voted to scrap the uk's opt-out despite instructions to the contrary from their own government
now that we have a further review and considering that many eu countries want their workers to have the choice to work more flexible hours can president barroso confirm that this commission will propose a directive that respects national opt-outs from the forty-eight hour working week
