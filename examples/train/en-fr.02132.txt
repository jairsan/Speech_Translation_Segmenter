mr president would you trust an economic forecaster who had recently said this the euro has done more to enforce budgetary discipline in the rest of europe than any number of exhortations from the imf or the oecd
or this the euro has already provided great internal stability for the eurozone
or this if we get rid of sterling and adopt the euro we will also get rid of sterling crises and sterling over-valuations

all three of those quotations come from our former colleagues in this house nick clegg and chris huhne now alarmingly ministers in the british government

believe me i am not gloating for the sake of it
a friend of mine just said that there is nothing more irritating than being wise during the event
