mr president this is not about telling member states exactly what they should or should not be spending their money on
each country has its own immediate priorities for getting themselves out of their financial difficulties
but when member states do receive that aid from the european union under this provision they should be encouraged to spend it in a way that respects the principles of the union in other words not ignoring the need for social protection and social inclusion
this financial crisis has hit people across the european union hard and therefore it is right that this fund exists
millions of people have lost their jobs
many of those who have become unemployed in those member states are the most vulnerable and the least likely to find employment quickly
that is why it is important that social safety nets in those member states are not ignored
we have asked in our oral question particularly about whether member states are required to include an evaluation of the social impact in their reports that they submit to the commission
i would be pleased if you can inform us about whether that is the case
it is important that we give the right message to member states that are receiving european funding through the medium-term financial assistance
i believe personally that we must make it clear that the commission might take into account the way the most vulnerable have been helped before agreeing any further assistance
i know that when member states are in financial difficulties it is quite often not easy to continue to be aware of their social obligations hence this oral question
it is so important to remember that this financial crisis has a human face as well and that face is represented quite often by the already most marginalised in society
