mr president i am pleased that our parliament was able to adopt this resolution by such an impressive vote with no votes against
we and i personally supported this resolution because the european parliament has to have a clear position and to find common ground even if the resolution adopted today does not correspond fully to the position of the socialist group
let me reiterate that the socialist group expresses its deepest outrage at the violence in the gaza strip the consequences of the disproportionate use of force by the israeli army and the military escalation that is causing many hundreds of victims most of them civilians including many children and that we strongly regret that civilian and un targets have been hit
we stress again that any upgrading of political relations between the eu and israel must be strongly conditioned on respect for international humanitarian law on real commitment to a comprehensive peace settlement on an end to the humanitarian crisis in gaza and the occupied palestinian territory and on respect for full implementation of the ec-plo interim association agreement
