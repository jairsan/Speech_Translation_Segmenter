mr president i hope everyone enjoyed cancún
it is a lovely place but i am a bit disappointed to see that none of them has a suntan
well i suppose that is to be expected really because while many of you were out there lecturing us on how we need to change our lifestyles to combat global warming it was actually the coldest week that mexican city had seen for over a hundred years
back in the uk we have also had the spectacle of scientists trying to suggest that one of the coldest novembers we have seen in the last hundred years was actually caused by global warming
do these people think we were born yesterday
this also explains why even more british people now believe that global warming is a scam and a way to raise taxes and exert control
but what have you actually achieved in cancún beyond handing over masses of taxpayers money in the guise of the green climate fund which i suggest will end up being a lucky bag for african dictators to buy themselves more mercedes benzes and private jets
personally i think the name of the green climate fund should be changed and i think the politics of envy fund would be better and closer to the truth
