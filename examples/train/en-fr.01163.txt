mr president i welcome the positive and determined stance being taken by the swedish presidency and particularly the minister's determination that the agreement in copenhagen should be upgradable and include monitoring mechanisms so that it can be adjusted in the light of new scientific research
the eu climate package passed in december two thousand and eight was important in showing the seriousness of our commitment to climate change and what has been agreed in recent months under the swedish presidency has also been important particularly the recast energy performance of buildings directive which will slash the carbon footprint of both new and renovated buildings
however there is one glaring gap in europe's plans and that is investment
it is a startling fact that the us despite not having passed legislation has committed more than usd one hundred billion to clean-energy spending and china has pledged usd two hundred billion in its economic stimulus plan whereas the eu commitment is little more than usd fifty billion
we should bear that in mind and not be too self-congratulatory in the run-up to copenhagen
