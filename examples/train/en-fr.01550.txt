mr president the system whereby the eu gives preferential treatment in trade to some countries has been in place since nineteen seventy-one
it is supposed to be a mechanism to resolve trade imbalances between developed capitalist countries and the poorer countries of the world and to contribute to sustainable development
commissioner will you agree that in that respect it has been really a dismal failure and that eu trade agreements have mainly benefited eu-based transnational corporations who use their superior resources to batter small local producers in many poorer countries causing serious dislocation including loss of local employment and environmental destruction
is that not the real meaning of the eu commission's document strategy paper on global europe competing in the world published only three years ago
and commissioner what hope have the working people of africa asia and latin america when your commission only in recent weeks cravenly bent the knee to the criminal speculation of free-booting hedge fund merchants seeking massive quick profits through outrageous speculation against the euro and greece in particular
and you handed over the working class of greece and the poor of greece to the tender mercies of these parasites criminals in fact
what hope have the poor and working people outside the borders of europe in view of that situation
now the question asks how the eu commission evaluates whether the states that benefit from preferential trade agreements with the eu protect workers rights and protect human rights
please tell us that
and how can you continue relations with the government of colombia where quite clearly government-controlled agencies especially the army are ongoingly guilty of the most heinous crimes as only recently shown in the horrific discovery of the mass grave of innocent murder victims in la macarena
and finally what is the commission's up-to-date view with regard to continuing gsp with sri lanka considering that after the election the policies of mr rajapaksa's government continue to be against human rights and workers rights in that country
