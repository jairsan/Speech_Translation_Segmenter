madam president today terrorist bombings are a daily occurrence in both afghanistan and pakistan
schools shopping centres town centres and even military headquarters are under attack
the pakistani military is successfully pushing back infiltrators into pakistan from afghanistan but i have to ask myself from where are these terrorists continuing to get their weapons
it is far too simplistic to argue that it is a pakistani internal issue in itself
it is much more complex than that
minister malmstr√∂m quite rightly raised the issue of regional cooperation
through our new foreign affairs role high representative will we be speaking to pakistan's neighbours to encourage them to do all that they can to help pakistan through this difficult time
it is also quite right that whilst mutual mistrust exists between pakistan and india and i am a great proponent of bringing these two countries together there is very little progress that we will make
as long as the core issue of kashmir is not dealt with i am afraid that we will not make a huge amount of progress
