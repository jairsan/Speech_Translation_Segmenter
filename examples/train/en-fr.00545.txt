mr president the idea behind the directive on integrated pollution prevention and control ippc was to enable us to achieve maximum environmental benefit for minimum cost giving much flexibility to industry and to member states
however as the commissioner has pointed out that principle is being abused many member states have interpreted best available techniques in manners not intended by the commission
therefore i very much support the rapporteur's idea of setting a minimum standard
the fact that our rapporteur is german perhaps has some involvement in this germany has a very good record in this instance
i do not see why a member state that has invested in making sure that its industry is setting high environmental standards should be undermined competitively and environmentally by those member states that are not prepared to make similar investments
i want to turn also to the opportunity this recast directive gives us to amend the directive on large combustion plants
i am very keen on seeing emission performance standards introduced for large coal and gas plants because of the huge quantities of co they emit
however there is much debate taking place as a result of the concern we now have about global warning concern which perhaps was not felt quite so acutely when we put this directive into law
to some extent there is a balance between old traditional pollutants and the new concern of global warming gases
in my own country it is quite likely that we are going to face severe electricity shortages from the end of twenty fifteen with the closure of many old coal-fired power plants that have not been modernised in line with large combustion plant requirements
personally i am prepared to see a trade-off
i am prepared at second reading to negotiate a derogation an extension of the large combustion plant requirements to keep old plants running so long as we do not end up building new coal-fired power plants locking us into high emissions of co for decades to come
however it has to be a genuine trade-off there has to be a genuine commitment from member states to make the changes necessary to reduce their co emissions in order to allow the continued pollution from existing plants for a few years longer
