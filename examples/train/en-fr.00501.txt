madam president in reading through this report i came across the definition of a social economy and i was interested to see what the definition was
it pointed out two things that struck me one was social objectives over capital and the other was the principles of solidarity and responsibility
furthermore it talked about democratic control by members
no mention was made of the willing and free exchange between buyer and seller in order to produce the profit which can then be reinvested to create jobs
what could be more social than making a profit to re-invest to create jobs for your population
when we start to focus on so-called social needs rather than the need to create profit and the need to make sure that we can create jobs and spread wealth throughout an economy we end up in the trap that hayek the great austrian economist and also ayn rand warned about at the beginning of the last century where we forget about profit and start on the slippery slope to serfdom
for that reason i was against this report
