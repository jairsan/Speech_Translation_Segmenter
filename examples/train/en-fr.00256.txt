mr president on occasions like this it is sometimes worth going back to first principles and asking why it is we need european regulation in this field at all
if you want to sell me something and i want to buy it from you and both customer and retailer are content with the units of measurement surely it is not for any national government let alone the european union to come between them and declare their transaction illegal
that may sound like an abstruse or academic point but in my home country there have been legal actions that have taken up an enormous amount of time and caused huge distress to people because they have been dealing with their customers in units with which those customers are comfortable
this is another example of how power has shifted away from the nation states and towards those whom we cannot vote for in european institutions
i should just like to repeat our call for a referendum on the lisbon treaty
