madam president in the last two months i have suffered victimisation by the uk labour regime including withdrawal of my house of commons pass refusal to allow me to enter the sellafield nuclear processing plant despite my position on a subcommittee of the committee on the environment public health and food safety and the refusal of the citizens advice bureau to sell me an information database openly advertised for sale to all other meps
madam president would you agree that political discrimination is not only unlawful but is also an attack not just on me but also on the functionality of this place and most important of all on the voters and the entire democratic process
