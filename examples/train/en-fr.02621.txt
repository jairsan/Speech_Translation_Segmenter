mr president i want to make clear on behalf of the european conservative and reformist group that we are in favour of the european stability mechanism which has been set up but we voted against the brok gualtieri report because that opinion was not in line with the conclusions reached by the council
what the brok gualtieri report wanted was for the european parliament and for the commission effectively to interfere with an intergovernmental mechanism
it is entirely appropriate that this mechanism should be intergovernmental because of the enormous sums of money which are being committed to it
national ministers responsible to their national parliaments that is the correct line of responsibility
underlying the whole euro crisis of course is not a problem with the euro but a problem with governments that are spending too much of their taxpayers money
