mr president in agreement with the shadows of the ppe-de pse and verts ale groups i would like to propose an oral amendment to paragraph one g
it consists of two small changes
the first change is that we replace the words fails to meet in the second sentence with may not conform to <unk> that the second sentence will read and that as a result the agreement may not conform to eu and international data protection standards
the second small change is in the last sentence where i would like to replace the word leaves by might leave <unk> that it reads considers that this might leave the agreement open to legal challenge
