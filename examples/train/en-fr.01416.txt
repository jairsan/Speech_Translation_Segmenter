mr president at the very moment when the good people of massachusetts were voting against excessive taxation and excessive government our own commission nominees were boasting of their plans to harmonise taxation in the european union and create a separate revenue stream for brussels
how are we to explain this difference between the two unions
it seems to be that you have to look for an explanation in the foundational dna of the two polities
the us was founded out of a popular revolt against a remote and autocratic government and against high taxation whereas of course the european union in line one of article one of its foundational treaty commits itself to ever-closer union
in doing so it sets its face against the competition the external curve which is the main constraint on government
that is why we now see acting according to its foundational doctrines this intolerance for tax competition masquerading as an attack on tax havens by which it in fact means jurisdictions which have run a more efficient system and kept their taxes lower
the reality is that tax competition tax havens if you insist on calling them that is the major way to keep the government small and the citizen large and free
