mr president i take due note of mr cottigny's report on what is an important directive which consolidates at european level a fundamental social right of employees
the commission attaches great importance to informing and consulting employees at both national and transnational level particularly in the current difficult context of the financial crisis
we proposed the recasting of the directive on european work councils
this has been successfully completed
we are continuing our work on the anticipation and socially responsible management of restructuring and the questions arising at european level from the negotiation of transnational agreements
as explained in its communication of seventeen march two thousand and eight the commission's prime concern for the implementation of directive two thousand and two fourteen ec is that it should be comprehensive and effective in collaboration with the member states and the two sides of industry which have an extremely important role to play as you know
it should be borne in mind that the directive only establishes a general framework that can be implemented and expanded by the two sides of industry particularly at company level
the commission conducts and supports activities for raising awareness promoting the exchange of best practices and boosting the capacities of all the parties involved by means of seminars training courses studies and financial aid for projects particularly under a specific budget line
the commission also monitors the correct application of the directive in its capacity as guardian of the treaties for example if complaints are made by trade union organisations
so far however the commission has received very few complaints concerning the implementation of this directive
