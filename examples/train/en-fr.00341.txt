mr president i noted carefully what the rapporteur said
there are two categories involved here access to information on eu legislative work and access to documents in the non-legislative field
in relation to the former i support what is being called active transparency to the point of freedom of information as the norm and indeed very reduced use of secret meetings and room documents at council level
i think we should know how our ministers vote so that they can be held to account to stop this blame brussels culture that goes on in national parliaments at home
i should also like easy access to meps records of attendance and voting during parliamentary work at all levels
we are elected by the citizens to do a job and we are entitled to be held to account by them
on the other hand to suggest that all political groups or party meetings must be open to public scrutiny is patent nonsense and a recipe for an agenda to be hijacked
i have no fear of transparency
we do an honourable job here as politicians and we must stand up for the dignity of our profession
