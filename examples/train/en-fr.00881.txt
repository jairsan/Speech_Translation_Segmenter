i would like to thank the czech presidency for the chairing of the committee and their views on this
as i asked one of your colleagues before could i have assurances now as we approach the critical meeting that will be the unfcc cop fifteen in copenhagen this december that we will have the enthusiastic support of the czech government for an adequate and fully equitable global agreement to reduce carbon emissions worldwide
you started your presidency with the reputation of being climate-sceptics
can you confirm now that you are converts and that you fully agree with the legislative climate and energy package that was passed overwhelmingly last december by this parliament
