mr president the last two decades of implementation of the cfp have shown that dealing with mediterranean fisheries separately through mesh-specific regulations only perpetuates the double standard in fisheries management in europe atlantic versus mediterranean
this has resulted in a chronic status quo of mismanagement lack of enforcement and overfishing in the mediterranean sea
only by making mediterranean stakeholders from fishermen to governments accountable alongside their atlantic counterparts all subject to common standards and formal processes can there be a decisive break from the past
neither mediterranean marine ecosystems and fish stocks nor fishermen and society at large can afford a new failure by the cfp to fully address mediterranean fisheries this time
european fisheries in the mediterranean must cease to be considered as an outlier and must be fully and firmly covered by all aspects of the new cfp
this means that the conservation policy has to be provided with a new and fully fledged operational scheme for fishing effort management of mediterranean fisheries
this should deliver into the same conservation standards as the long-established operational scheme applied to atlantic fisheries
