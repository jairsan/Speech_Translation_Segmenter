madam president i have tried not to be judge and jury on this irish case because that is not why we are here tonight but i would like to ask the commissioner three questions what volume of pcbs is still in circulation can you guarantee that none of these will contaminate the food chain in the next twenty-three months when they are still in the process of disposal and would the commission present a report on the status of implementation of the feed hygiene regulation which this house would like to hear
i would also like to point out to jim allister that this a cross-border issue
the contamination as we understand it came as jim nicholson rightly pointed out from across the border
that is why i do not agree with proinsias
this a european issue because it has a cross-border dimension
what happened in ireland could happen in any member state because there are as i understand it thousands of tonnes of pcbs in circulation
perhaps the commissioner could clarify that point
