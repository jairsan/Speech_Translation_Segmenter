mr president the murder of governor salmaan taseer is indeed a brutal and tragic crime
he was killed apparently by an islamic extremist because he advocated changes to the blasphemy law
the murder is a tragedy for pakistan but what does it mean for the west
instead of doing all we can to combat islamic fundamentalism taking deeper root in europe we placate and appease it
sharia law is now recognised in some tribunals in the uk
there are inner city areas where the de facto writ of sharia law runs
europe having produced the renaissance the enlightenment the industrial revolution and the wonders of the modern scientific age now lies supine before a sixth century ideology
governments are frightened to confront it because of political correctness and the economic power of some islamic countries
we must support the moderate and progressive elements in countries like pakistan but above all we must assert that sharia law and islamic fundamentalism have no place in a modern western liberal democracy
