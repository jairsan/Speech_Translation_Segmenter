mr president i have lodged an amendment to the technical measures regulation to try to resolve the anomaly that ian hudghton just referred to which has arisen off the west coast of scotland
in a well-intentioned attempt to conserve white-fish stocks in this area the commission introduced temporary catch composition rules for a period of twelve months at the end of two thousand and nine but these temporary rules have already been rolled over for a further year under a catch-all agreement that extended all eu technical measures for twelve months
now the commission is seeking to roll the rules over yet again to the end of twenty twelve while it prepares a new framework for technical measures under the cfp reform package
the unintended consequence of this will mean that a temporary regulation that was introduced for a period of only one year will now run for at least three years during which time the circumstances in the west of scotland have changed dramatically forcing our fishermen to dump good fresh haddock back into the sea dead
i hope parliament will support my amendment tomorrow
