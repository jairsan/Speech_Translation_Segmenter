mr president it was in january when we adopted a resolution on belarus
it is not a good sign at all that we have to express our concerns on the situation there again and again with no positive reaction from the belarusian authorities
although the european union has re-established sanctions and taken a hard line on lukashenko's regime fundamental rights such as freedom of assembly and of expression are still violated and trampled upon
furthermore the reports on continuous mental and physical torture of political prisoners and attempts at recruiting informants to the kgb give the european union a clear signal that lukashenko's regime did not get our message from the previous time
perhaps we ought to speak up and make it even clearer that the situation in belarus is unacceptable
i would like to ask the commission to report on further measures that can be taken against lukashenko's regime
i would also like to call on european enterprises and investors to withdraw from belarus if they have no desire to be handling blood money and directly or indirectly supporting lukashenko's criminal regime
