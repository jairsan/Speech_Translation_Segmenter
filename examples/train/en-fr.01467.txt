mr president mr barroso talked earlier on about wanting an ambitious strategy and it is true that there are parts of the document eu twenty twenty which are ambitious but certainly the greenhouse gas emission figure is not ambitious it is pathetic and it is not going to get us where we want to go
we should be looking at forty by twenty twenty
of course the issue is not only about climate but also about resource availability and increasing resource efficiency
there is a lot as well that we seem to have seen before in this strategy not least about economic growth coming through more and more as a goal rather than an indicator
it should not be the goal of a strategy
the eu has many areas where we have tried to decouple growth from transport energy use whatever and it has long been decoupled from jobs
so can we please not talk as if somehow growth is going to deliver jobs
we also need to be looking not just at reducing poverty but reducing inequalities because that has known demonstrable benefits and we need to make sure that our financial institutions do not undermine the ambitious goals that we might put in place
