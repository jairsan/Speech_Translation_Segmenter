mr president on behalf of the delegation for relations with india may i firstly give my sincere condolences to the families and friends of all those who were killed in last week's horrific terrorist atrocities in mumbai and wish all those injured a speedy recovery
my sympathy also to colleagues and officials of the european parliament caught up in these horrific and outrageous attacks
i have written to the indian prime minister and the chief minister of maharashtra to express our sympathy
coordinated attacks such as these are designed to spread fear and mistrust amongst citizens and to test democracy's commitment to deeply held values
as such they require a robust response from all those who cherish democracy and international law
therefore i welcome president p√∂ttering's strong statements in support of india
as a parliament we need now to move away from words and provide concrete actions that can support india's needs
