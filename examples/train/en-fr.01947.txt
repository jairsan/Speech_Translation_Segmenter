mr president the real issue surrounding mr <unk> excellent report on the employment guidelines is whether the council will take the recommendations into consideration
last night i was pleased to hear the belgian presidency commit to looking at the parliament's recommendations
i would say to the council that it is crucial that they take on board many of the really excellent recommendations in mr <unk> report in particular i think those referring to improved governance
everybody agrees that the open method of coordination was certainly not effective with regard to the lisbon agenda
we need to ensure that the targets and sub-targets contained are monitored and evaluated against the eu twenty twenty objectives
i am pleased that amendment sixty-two was accepted as if implemented i think that will help to ensure that there is a reduction in regional disparities
finally i fully support the concept that employment-enhancing growth should be based on decent work as promoted by the ilo
