i want to ask the commissioner if he will look at the non-direct financing aspects of the problems that smes are encountering
for example i do not know what it is like in your country but in my country there is no such thing as a bank manager any more
we are giving money to banks but banks do not assess people on their track record on their character and on the knowledge of their business
we got into the mess we are in because people were on automatic
to some extent they are still on automatic
how do you win an election
one vote at a time
if we can get one job in every sme in europe we will end the unemployment crisis
i ask you please to consult with the european central bank and european investment bank and try to bring your influence to bear to get us back to traditional bank managers who engage with smes and help them to develop their businesses
it will return a dividend
