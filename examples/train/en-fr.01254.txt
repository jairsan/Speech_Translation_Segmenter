president barroso the european anti-poverty network has described your consultation document on the twenty twenty strategy as a step backwards from commitments by successive european councils to strengthen the social dimension
your document only mentions flexicurity and training
you should know that on this side of the house we cannot accept a strategy that is devoid of social content
twenty ten will be the european year against poverty and social exclusion
should you not make the fight against the scourge of poverty and exclusion the centrepiece of the twenty twenty strategy
finally recognising that a third of all jobs created since the year two thousand in the european union are in the health social and employment services making a double contribution to reducing poverty providing services and creating employment should the twenty twenty strategy not set targets for the provision of high-quality social services
