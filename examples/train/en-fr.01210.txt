madam president of course the frozen chicken example that you all well know is already a bit old but still now for example tomatoes that are highly subsidised in the european union make it to african markets are cheaper than the local products and therefore destroy jobs and increase poverty
so that is still a common phenomenon and i think we have to work on that
