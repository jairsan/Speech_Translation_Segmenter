mr president next week all across the world people will be celebrating the life of scotland's national poet robert burns
as many of you know a central part of a burns supper is a haggis
currently there is a ban in the usa on importing scottish haggis yet one in three americans claim scottish ancestry and would like to try some authentic scottish haggis
what action can the commission and the council take in their transatlantic dialogues to put scottish haggis back not just on the agenda but also on the menu when it comes to american traditional scottish burns suppers
