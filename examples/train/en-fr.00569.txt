mr president the term european solidarity has been bandied around this morning as if it were a given
i want to call that into question
we cannot sign a blank cheque to bail out the countries of eastern europe
we do not have the money
economically the plan is quite unsound and most important of all it is politically unacceptable to the taxpayers in france britain and germany that we should do so
yet the british chancellor of the exchequer alistair darling seems now to be an advocate of this plan
he has lost his marbles he says that this is the time for europe to build on shared values of cooperation as if we are one big happy family
well the hungarian prime minister mr ferenc gyurcsany rather blows that idea of european solidarity apart
he demands that the european union bail out countries such as his to the tune of eur one hundred and eighty billion and he says that if we do not do that he promises us that five million unemployed migrants will head west into our countries
that is nothing other than blackmail and it shows the folly of having allowed countries like hungary into this political union and highlights even more deeply the folly of having open borders
the only response i really hear in this house today is that somehow we have to have more european union that more power will work well look you were sent a message by the voters in france by the voters in the netherlands and by the voters in ireland
you do not have the legitimacy to take more power for the european union
the economic crisis will i believe be what voters will vote on in the european elections this year and i hope this time they send you people a message that is so big and so loud that for once you simply will not be able to ignore it
