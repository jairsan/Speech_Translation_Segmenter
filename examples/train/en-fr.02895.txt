mr president the situation in madagascar is the classical situation where the new is no better than the old
this illegal regime came into power in two thousand and nine with military support and matters have not improved one bit
so all the old bad habits remain unlawful killings mental and physical torture of prisoners overcrowding and pre-trial detention are rampant and of course poverty abounds with the minimum wage of usd thirty-five per month
the solution is obvious
we need a democratic regime there and we at the european union must do our best to establish that because without that progress cannot be made
if we can get free elections and a new government in place the european union in conjunction with other international bodies particularly the african union can help nurture this country along on the road to democracy and the road to economic recovery
