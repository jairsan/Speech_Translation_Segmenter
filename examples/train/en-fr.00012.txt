mr commissioner can i ask you why you think the european union is losing the information battle on the advantage of strong and consistent biofuel targets particularly in a world of more limited supply
i would like to ask this in relation to biodiesel which has the potential to make a significant contribution to enhancing the european union's security of energy supply
biodiesel can be produced in accordance with sustainability principles without endangering food supply which you have referred to and biodiesel is the only renewable energy where europe holds a strong wide leadership
