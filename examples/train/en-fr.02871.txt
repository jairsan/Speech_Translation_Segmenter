madam president i had asked to have a clear line from the european parliament
well there was no clear line from the european parliament
i heard a lot of diverging opinions which in itself shows how complex this matter is
so let me underline once more that the commission respects the lisbon treaty and does not intervene in the sovereignty of nation states
on behalf of president barroso i would like to underline once more that the commission does not make political judgments on the fundamental constitutional and institutional choices that a member state makes
the adoption of a new constitution in a member state is a matter for its people and for its institutions
as i have already underlined we could become competent when the constitution is translated into legislative administrative or judicial practice
i can assure parliament that we would not hesitate for a moment to intervene in such a case if the treaty or the charter was violated or if union law was not respected
turning to ms guillaume's question on union law when union law is at stake i have never shied away from action
the question raised by ms guillaume concerns an awareness-raising campaign on the work-life balance which was supported by the progress programme
this is part of the campaign consisting of promotion material showing a foetus with the words let me live with the commission's logo
i made it very clear this campaign is not in line with the progress programme and it is not in line with the project proposal submitted to the commission services by the hungarian authorities
therefore the commission asked for this part of the campaign to be stopped without further delay and for all existing posters to be removed
if this is not done we will start procedures to terminate the ground agreement and draw necessary consequences including financial ones
that is how we answer when european law is at stake
constitutions are not within our competence
