madam president the position of this group has been consistent throughout my position as rapporteur has been consistent ever since two thousand and two when we first proposed the inclusion of self-employed and independent drivers
we remain convinced that that needs to be the case and i very much hope therefore that the proposal to reject the commission's proposal will be agreed in the vote tomorrow just as it was in plenary last spring and in the employment committee this march
we very much regret the confusion the rapporteur appears to have encountered in discharging her mandate
rather than reflecting and promoting the clear majority views of members of the european parliament's employment committee she has actively worked to promote the view of the commission and council
the other institutions as mme ber√®s has said have shown not one gram of loyal cooperation but instead have gone out of their way to subvert the very clear employment committee recommendation to the plenary the rejection of the commission's proposal
madam president a tired driver is a dangerous driver irrespective of employment status we should not make road travel any more of a gamble than it already is
once again this morning the rapporteur has shown confusion between the notions of driving time and working time
it is quite possible under the existing regime for a self-employed a false <unk> driver to drive between eighty-six and ninety-five hours per week perhaps not every week but one week is enough of a danger in itself
if the commissioner doubts that figure he can come to see me any time he likes i have the figures from the people working in the sector
this is a fact
we must reject the commission's proposal
