mr president i am grateful to you for this opportunity to say a few words on behalf of the presidency and on behalf of the council in response to you and to the interventions from the representatives of the political groups
it is particularly significant for us that the five years of this legislature have coincided with the first five years of membership of the european union for the czech republic and for the other countries which joined at that time
all the more so given that the czech republic has had the privilege of holding the council presidency as this legislature draws to a close
i would first like to pay tribute to you mr president for the exemplary manner in which you have led this institution throughout the last two and a half years
it is a powerful witness to your qualities in particular of fairness and integrity that you are held in such respect by this parliament a respect which clearly cuts across party political divisions
as one of the relatively few members first elected back in nineteen seventy-nine you have been able to bring your considerable experience wisdom and knowledge to this office
speaking in particular on behalf of the presidency i can only say that we have very much appreciated all your qualities in the contacts we have had both before and during our presidency
on behalf of the council may i wish you all the best for the future
i hope you will allow me since we are looking back over the past five years to pay tribute also to your predecessor mr borrell who manifested the same qualities of impartiality and leadership
you have both ensured that this office of president is one which is held in respect and esteem
this parliament and the union more generally have good reasons to be grateful to you both
during the course of the last five years this parliament has made effective use of its powers and prerogatives not least in the important area of codecision where the council and parliament find themselves on opposite sides of the table sometimes with very different views and objectives
despite these differences both institutions work together to ensure that the system delivers
we can disagree and we can argue constructively but we do so within a framework of agreed rules and procedures
i think both institutions can take some pride in our shared commitment to making the system work and the last five years have provided plenty of examples that it does work and work very effectively
mr president honourable members in less than three months time a new parliament will take up office
there will be many new members
you will elect a new president and a different member state will be seated here as the presidency representing the council
i am sure that all of them will during the course of the next five years look back with gratitude and respect at the legacy which you mr president have left this institution
thank you for your attention
