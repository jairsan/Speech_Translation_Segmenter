madam president this motion is badly needed
even though we have the two thousand and six directive it is plain that it is not working as well as it should
the companies we have heard of exist solely to swindle unsuspecting and sometimes over-stretched organisations and i find that particularly outrageous when they are damaging community enterprises often with limited budgets
using tactics like those of bully-boys and racketeers they dangle promises in front of unsuspecting people but i think the message has got to be that if an offer seems to be too good to be true then most probably it is
these companies are like predatory sharks and they should be stopped
certainly our group welcomes this resolution it is very timely and we will be supporting it as it calls on the commission to require member states to adequately enforce the directive
