mr president the previous speaker mentioned that she is calling for some sort of commission to go to sri lanka to look at what is going on on the ground there
could i just remind her that the south asia delegation has just been to sri lanka and i see several members of that delegation in the chamber
indeed my colleague mr mann referred to the visit there the previous speaker is obviously not listening to what is going on in this debate
people have been to sri lanka
they know sri lanka and they know what is going on
i do not know where ms delli is getting all this nonsense from
