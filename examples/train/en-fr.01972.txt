madam president firstly i would like to express commissioner potoƒçnik's disappointment at not being able to be here today
he is presently in ghent participating at the informal ministerial meeting on the eu position for the tenth meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity which is to take place this october in nagoya
i wish to thank parliament and in particular the rapporteurs ms elisabeth jeggle and former mep mr neil parish the shadows and all those who have worked equally hard in the preparation of this very important piece of legislation
i am delighted to be able to note the excellent collaboration between parliament the council and the commission
the negotiation between the institutions and the consultations before and during the codecision procedure proved to be challenging as the diverse and often sharply divergent views and needs of member states industry academia and animal welfare advocates had to be taken into account and reflected as far as possible in the text
i believe that the result constitutes a fair and workable piece of legislation which successfully strikes a balance between promoting european research and competitiveness and also ensuring that full regard is paid to animal welfare
the revision was much needed as it was vital to significantly improve conditions for experimental animals clarify the legal obligations and ensure a level playing field within the eu
once the new legislation is implemented the european union will be able to lay claim to having the highest standards of experimental animal welfare in the world lifting the bar throughout the twenty-seven member states of the european union in a manner that will not compromise but foster the competitiveness of our research and industry
we consider that the text put to your vote today retains all the key elements of the commission's original proposal
i therefore believe that if your vote is positive then the commission's ambitious objectives for this revision will have been achieved
