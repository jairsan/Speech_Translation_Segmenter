mr president in principle i have no problem with the idea of quality logos
we see quality logos in a number of areas of our life
just so long as this is not being used as an excuse to override the choices of the consumer
if food does not meet certain size restrictions or aesthetic restrictions we should not be throwing it away throwing it onto the heap as we see happen with thirty of european agricultural produce that is often wasted because it does not meet strict european standards
we should also not be using our quality standards as an excuse to ban imports from farmers in developing countries throwing those farmers into poverty and then taking our taxpayers money to throw at corrupt governments when the farmers fall into poverty
surely rather than quality marks and gestures like this we should be trusting the market we should trust the consumers and we should trust the people
