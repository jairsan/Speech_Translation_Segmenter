mr president we stand at the beginning of a new era and perhaps we should pose ourselves three questions who how and what
the who was more or less answered last week and nobody could be more pleased than me
in a week where we started with only three women in the commission we finish with nine
i can advise some of those that the women meps in suits and ties have stood down for the moment but they will be back in five years time if the process does not improve
next time please can we have a process where all member states nominate a woman and a man as candidates so that we do not have the last-minute rush
that is what i want to talk about as well the how
this process was untransparent
it has been mentioned that we now have to think about the practical implications of the lisbon treaty
let us make transparency the watchword for our three institutions and how we deal with one another how we are open to the public
transparency must rule in the future
the what must be the focus on our citizens
the new stockholm programme is a good start much more citizen-centric than any of its predecessors but we must continue to protect our citizens rights in giving them protection but also making sure that their daily lives are easier across europe
