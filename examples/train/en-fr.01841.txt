mr president we are indeed fortunate i suppose to be talking about this at the time of the world cup because what the world cup illustrates more than almost any other sporting event is just how important sport is to people just how many millions and millions of people watch football and how much pleasure and passion is invested in it
because of this it is so important that we actually make sure that the game of football and other sports are regulated properly and that we do now take the action which has been discussed for so long about players agents
we are unfortunately as has been mentioned seeing some very serious things going on abuse money laundering corruption exploitation of underage players things which are serious crimes against which we really must take the action which we have been planning for so long
what better time to be doing that than now when the whole world it seems is consumed by football
