madam president this is not a question of what is liked or not liked in ireland
we are members of the european parliament and we will put our views forward
we will not be told what to do by any representatives of any other member state
we are not obliged in this country to do what is liked in other member states
every member state sends its parliamentarians here for them to put their views forward
our views are that the case for the ccctb which is currently being denigrated in berlin is the sort of propaganda that came off the top of somebody's head
the case for it has not been proven
there is a case for and against this and we should not be bludgeoned into this by any flavour-of-the-day political correctness
