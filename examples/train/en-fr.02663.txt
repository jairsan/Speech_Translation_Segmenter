mr president one of our rapporteurs spoke of the distrust of fishermen for the common fisheries policy
it is little wonder because the common fisheries policy currently constituted has seen the destruction of our fleet but has not seen the build-up of fish stocks
from my point of view the sooner we can get fisheries policy returned to member states the better
however i recognise that this is unlikely to happen in the short term so i have a few observations to make on this joint fisheries debate
first the issue of establishing a community financial measure for the implementation of the common fisheries policy
so long as the eu is able to interfere in our fisheries it would seem to me that that interference should be properly funded
however while we seek to guarantee the funding that is available for the administration of the cap we should bear a thought for the stakeholders in particular our fishermen who struggle to keep abreast of the multitude of current rules and regulations let alone those they are consulted upon
i am increasingly hearing from a variety of maritime stakeholders that the entire industry is struggling to deal with this particular issue
