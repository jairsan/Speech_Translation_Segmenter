mr president i would like to give an explanation of the vote on the hennis-plasschaert report the so-called swift report dealing with terrorist finance tracking
i think the vote was confusing even by the standards of this place
we voted i believe not to vote and then voted to send the report back to committee
i wanted to vote to withhold my consent to the conclusion of the agreement
however i certainly did not want to vote in favour of paragraph two of the report which was to submit recommendations for a long-term agreement under the legal framework of the lisbon treaty
i do not want any agreement or any agreements under the lisbon treaty
the lisbon treaty is in contravention of the bill of rights of sixteen eighty-nine and england's other constitutional acts which have not been expressly repealed and which remain in force
because of this england and indeed the united kingdom is now living under an illegally constituted government
