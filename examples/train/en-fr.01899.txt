mr president commissioners first of all i want to thank the rapporteur for his report
on twenty-four july two thousand and eight in response to the economic crisis facing europe's fishing fleet the eu fisheries council approved temporary and specific measures aimed at promoting and restructuring the fleet
just as many fishermen tried to avail themselves of these measures they were hit with the fallout from the global recession
the value of nethrops or langoustines sold by my fishermen in northern ireland to other parts of europe plummeted
this at the same time as imports of shellfish and fish have become increasingly available
europe needs fish
we need fish imports but i would contend that these should not come at any cost
on the one hand my colleagues want to stop our fishermen receiving any subsidy
however the contradiction comes that as we seek to remove these subsidies european policy allows fish imports of unregulated fishery and aquaculture products that undermine the sustainable and economically viable fishing industry we strive for
europe cannot have it both ways
there is a lack of consistency and it is to reverse this that i support mr cadec's report
