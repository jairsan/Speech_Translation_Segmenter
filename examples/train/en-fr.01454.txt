mr president let me first emphasise the utter hypocrisy of the right-wing groups in this parliament which condemned the venezuelan government for the temporary withdrawal of broadcasting facilities for radio caracas television rctv and pretend to be champions of the freedom of the press
these are the same groups that stand for a system in europe where the vast majority of the media is controlled by billionaires and major private corporations who use this control on the one hand to reap massive profits for themselves and on the other hand to spew out pro-capitalist propaganda pro-market and pro-neoliberal propaganda who in the context of the present economic crisis vilify and abuse public sector workers for example relentlessly pushing an agenda that it is working-class people who must pay for the crisis and vilify without end those working class organisations that dare to disagree
bringing the issue of rctv into the human rights emergency resolution today is a major abuse of that procedure
by the way most of the media outlets in venezuela are in private ownership actually including powerful media corporations which conspired to overthrow hugo ch치vez in two thousand and two who happens to have been elected and re-elected many times by the people of venezuela
the reality is that the epp in this parliament has the same agenda as the coup conspirators they want to overthrow hugo ch치vez's government because this government has not carried out the bold dictates of world capitalism implementing privatisation and deregulation across the board and they want no opposition to the neoliberal agenda
yes the working class in latin america in general rise up in opposition
no i am not without some sharp criticisms of the venezuelan government
despite massive support from the majority of the venezuelan people hugo ch치vez in fact has not decisively broken with capitalism and led a movement to genuine democratic socialism
there is a trend towards bureaucratism in certain senses
finally co-thinkers of mine on the ground in the socialismo revolucion치rio group for example are fighting these trends and fighting for workers rights and genuine socialism which means by the way that the media would not be controlled either by capitalist interests or by bureaucratic interest but open democratically to all sectors of society
