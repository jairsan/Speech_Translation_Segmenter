mr president i want to mention amendment three where we criticised a number of commissioners for having downplayed long-standing requests by the european parliament to propose legislation for better supervision of the financial market
this is the reality of the situation but i think it is important also to state that member states must take their share of the blame
even if the commission had tried to move i think it would have met with a great deal of resistance
still the commission has a responsibility and while we have principles-based regulation as opposed to rules-based it still needs to be rigorous and light-touch regulation has not worked
i also want to mention paragraph twenty where parliament reiterates its respect for the result of the irish referendum and for the results of the ratification procedures in the other member states
during the debate on the irish referendum it was claimed time and time again that parliament would not respect the result
apart from anything else parliament has no competence here and no power to act one way or the other
still i welcome the statement unlike my colleague mr allister
finally in paragraph twenty i think it is possible to meet the concerns of the irish people before the european election but we should not underestimate what is needed here
it also states that parliament stands ready to offer assistance to forge a broader more informed consensus
i believe this really should be worded to forge a better-informed consensus
