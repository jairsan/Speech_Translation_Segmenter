madam president we all agree that greater energy efficiency is the first step in the chain but i want in my contribution to draw your attention to the political confusion and anxiety surrounding bio-energy
i think that this house in particular and the commission and europe in general ran away from parts of bio-energy when we had the food price hikes of two thousand and seven and two thousand and eight
few of us are talking about the realities for most farmers across europe now which is a crisis of confidence because prices have collapsed
yet there is no coherent political message to them on land use and using their land to grow energy crops
in ireland in particular we have the government running away from this area
look what industry needs is political certainty what politicians fail to deliver is that certainty and we have reaped the reward for it
if we are talking about investing in research and there is no uptake of the research because we will not make the right political decisions we are wasting our time
