mr president can i start by thanking mrs de br√∫n who took on this dossier expecting it to be fairly expeditious
it then became very complicated as we found ourselves negotiating whole new delegated acts without precedents for future acts so congratulations to her and to the council and commission
commissioner one of your first tasks here is to find a solution
a lot of the debate has been about the technical aspects of this legislation but it is an important piece of legislation for lots of citizens being about moving their pet freely around the eu
when we first adopted this legislation a few years ago there was a lot of support for it but we have this transitional period which mr fjellner has mentioned which is important to prevent diseases spreading to states that do not have those diseases
i welcome the commission's support for extending the transitional period so that when we do have the new legislation all countries will have the same legislation
we will by that point have much higher levels of animal health and animal welfare across the eu
on the comitology issue our group supports the compromise that has been negotiated
we think that parliament should have parity equality with the council in legislation
the whole issue was about the expert groups and who these experts should be
what we would like to say is that when we talk about experts being consulted this has to refer to all experts and the commission will be looking with experts from the member states from non-governmental organisations and also those perhaps which the european parliament is recommending
i am very pleased that we have this agreement
it enables the transitional period to be agreed in time for when the derogation runs out and we look forward to hearing the commission's new proposals for the future legislation
