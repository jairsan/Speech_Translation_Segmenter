madam president we have a relatively new european parliament and we almost have a new european commission
this is basically the first time with the tarabella report that we are voting on the action that the new parliament's committee on women's rights and gender equality wants taken in the coming years
the greens are very happy with this quite progressive report
it is brimful of plans that we want carried out
we finally want legislative action to be taken to further the sharing of care between men and women with a call for paternity leave
we finally propose to further women in decision making by looking at the norwegian practice of a quota for boards of directors
the greens are also really happy with the attention paid to the effects of the crisis on women women's unemployment differs and the effects on women of cuts in public spending differ
we should look at that seriously
we very much hope that parliament will show the courage and the readiness to combat discrimination of women and further equality with concrete measures that might actually bring results by voting in favour of this report
we hope that the commission will take action accordingly
