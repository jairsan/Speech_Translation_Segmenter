mr president the real test for any institutional structure including the eu is in time of crisis and we are in a time of crisis
the integration of the so-called new members is not complete the treaty of lisbon is not yet ratified by all member states and our dependence on imported energy is increasing
unfortunately although indispensable common action often comes slowly and with difficulty because members prefer the individual approach
if we let the latter prevail over the former our union is in great danger irrespective of the moral aspect that those who have benefited most from it have more obligation to see that it gets stronger and not weaker
and the same goes for nato too
now more than ever we need common analyses common perceptions common positions and common action with regard to the increasing challenges we are confronted with
let us do this so we will not be accused of wasting the most remarkable example of successful cooperation on a continent ravaged by wars for too long
