madam president there is an overwhelming desire in ireland to remain at the heart of european affairs and to ensure that europe can act effectively and transparently in the interests of the member states
this is particularly so and more important than ever in the current financial and economic crisis
irish citizens however need assurances that the no camp's misleading claims concerning the treaty of lisbon on the commission on abortion on conscription on military neutrality on workers rights and on public services have no basis in fact
to significantly enhance the possibility of ratification of the treaty of lisbon a decision needs to be made by the heads of state that once the treaty of lisbon is in place its mechanism will be used to make certain that all member states will recover the right to nominate a commissioner without restriction
a simple extension of that right from twenty fourteen to twenty nineteen will not in my view be sufficient to ensure ratification in ireland
in addition a commitment to add a social clause on labour rights to the posting of workers directive similar to the clause added to the services directive would go a long way to address the dangers that arise from the laval viking and r√ºffert judgments which were also a cause of concern in ireland
i would urge the council and the commission to address these matters urgently at the coming summit
