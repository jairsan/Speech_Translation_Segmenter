mr president according to the treaty on the functioning of the european union the conclusion of this agreement between the european union and the swiss confederation needs the consent of parliament before the agreement can come into force
i want to thank the committee on culture and education and particularly its chair doris pack for their constructive approach to the agreement
since switzerland refused to join the european economic area no agreement until now has allowed direct or indirect cooperation in education between the eu and switzerland
however switzerland has for a long time shown interest in our education and youth programmes
it has even developed a national support system to encourage partnerships with eu member states organisations active in these programmes
furthermore switzerland has participated in the bologna process and the creation of the european higher education area
switzerland has also followed closely albeit from the outside the debate on education policies in the european union
switzerland will be the first country to take part in our programmes that is neither an eu member state nor a member of the european economic area nor a current or potential eu candidate
the commission welcomes the participation of switzerland in the two programmes
the agreement will allow swiss education and youth organisations as well as individual students teachers and young people to participate in the eu's youth in action and lifelong learning programmes on completely equal terms with eu citizens
projects and initiatives submitted by participants from switzerland will be subject to the same conditions rules and procedures that apply to projects from member states
switzerland has established a national agency to coordinate implementation of the programmes at national level
it will make an annual financial contribution to each of the programmes and will attend programme committee meetings as an observer for the points that concern switzerland
thank you honourable members for the good work you have done in this case
