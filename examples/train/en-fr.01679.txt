i have to remind you that it was the commission that launched the climate change and energy package and that we have highlighted the great potential for the creation of jobs in some sectors of the so-called greening of the economy and that certainly the priority for the future is such one of the most important targets of the eu twenty twenty
we have put at the centre of the eu twenty twenty our climate and energy targets from twenty reduction of greenhouse gases to twenty renewables and to twenty gains in energy efficiency
for instance to have this target of twenty renewables we are going to create jobs throughout the renewables sector
so it is certainly the central piece of our economic strategy for the future and in fact we have put that as one of the core objectives
growth not only smart growth and equitable growth but also sustainable growth
