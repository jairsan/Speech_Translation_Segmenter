mr president it is estimated that three point two million european citizens are diagnosed with cancer each year and as the european population ages current trends would indicate that the number of citizens diagnosed each year is likely to double unfortunately over the next twenty years
we must of course address the plague of cancer
cancer is caused by many factors
i want to outline what i believe that smoking being overweight low fruit and vegetable intake physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption are contributory factors
it is essential that health promotion strategies at european level and indeed at national level are strengthened and properly resourced
early detection is vital and we have seen when we have early detection that it is so important that many people are still alive who would not have been if not for early detection
through cancer research the european union can play a leading role importantly over eur seven hundred and fifty million has been devoted to cancer research under the seventh framework programme and i would hope that more funding could be made available over the coming years
in conclusion i want to pay tribute to all of those particularly to those in my own country who provide such exceptional care to cancer patients
