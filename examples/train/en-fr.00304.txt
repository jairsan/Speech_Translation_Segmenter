madam president i do not accept that we have yet got a balanced package on this matter
for me this debate highlights two follies first the abject folly of the eu without pausing for even an impact assessment dashing down the road of banning multiple plant protection products not caring that there are no substitutes and that indigenous food production will drastically suffer particularly in the cereal and vegetable sector and thereby forcing ever-increasing dependence upon imports from countries who care nothing about these things
madam president i have heard much talk in this debate about science but what sort of science is it that does not subject itself to proper impact assessment
the second folly is that of my country in particular which is perhaps the most affected by these proposals having subjected itself to qualified majority voting in the council on these matters to the point where we are now probably going to be impotent to resist them
it is due to the idiocy of subjecting ourselves to qualified majority voting that we find ourselves in this position and yet some under lisbon would say we should hand over more and more subjects to that category
