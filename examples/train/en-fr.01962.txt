mr president transboundary challenges call for common efforts
the european parliament has rightly drawn attention to the need for a cooperative approach in this area
the european union promotes the spirit of cooperation needed to address the middle east region's serious water challenges and advocates treatment of the problems at source and not just the downstream symptoms
let me conclude by confirming that the european union will continue to contribute to the efforts to alleviate the water deficit in this region and to ensure the provision of clean water resources preserving the environment and safeguarding drinking water for the people of the region
the european union will continue to support activities conducive to a future rehabilitation of the jordan river and to the possible future establishment of joint and integrated management of the river basin if that is the choice of the countries in the region
the european union will keep supporting dialogue and promoting cross-border cooperation on water issues between the various neighbours in this region contributing to confidence building
serious efforts and political commitment are needed from the neighbours themselves to balance the available resources and demands
this includes not just governments but also civil society
as in europe individuals companies and local municipalities need to contribute to the sustainable management of water resources
this is a challenge that confronts us all
