madam president i wonder if commissioner tajani would agree that in a sense the biggest obstacle to the correct observation of community law are in fact our national governments
i will just give one example
about twenty years ago we agreed to have the four freedoms throughout the european union
in my constituency there are many people of italian origin one of whom is a teacher and obviously a fluent italian speaker
he returned to his family home in italy and was forbidden to teach in his family's native country because his training was undertaken in england
that surely must be wrong but there is nothing that we can do about it because the italian authorities say for whatever reason that this is reserved for italian nationals
the british government's behaviour at airports seems to me to be in flagrant breach of most european agreements
is there something the commission can do maybe by making a plea at the next summit to our national governments to show a bit of european solidarity
