mr president i welcome this report as a shot across the bows of supermarket giants
tesco for example recently announced profits of gbp two point eight billion while food producers in my constituency struggle to make a living
the major supermarkets have been abusing their buying power to suppress prices to suppliers to unsustainable levels and to impose i must say unfair and unilateral demands as the price of retaining the contract
in the long run as the uk competition commission has pointed out this will equally damage consumers as choice availability and quality are squeezed out of the market
thus i support the call for an investigation into the margin share in the production and distribution chain
someone somewhere is doing very nicely but it certainly is not the producer
