madam president we are all well aware that the creation of the single common market organisation is an attempt to improve transparency and to streamline and simplify legislation on the common agricultural policy
most sectors have already been successfully incorporated into the cmo
like mrs mcguinness i do not come from a wine-growing area so i will be very careful what i say thank you mrs lulling
i support mr parish's view that the wine sector should now be included in the amendment and while i understand the concerns expressed by some colleagues i feel we should be aiming to complete this technical process which will ultimately mean a reduction in red tape for farmers
that has got to be good
for wine-growing farmers it will be a bonus at the end of the day
