i would like to ask the commissioner when he is revisiting these questions and listening to parliament if he will again revisit the question of ethical research and ethical researchers
it is very clear that the destruction of embryos is no longer required and there are many other avenues for exploration
will he now start putting resources into those other avenues so that we can return to a fully ethical research base within the european union
