i will be brief
first of all i would like to compliment the commissioner in particular for her efforts on this issue
as a former journalist can i suggest that while a meeting of the commission might be interesting for the commission we cannot force people to watch it
the problem is information without emotion will not be taken up and i am afraid europe is pretty dull and boring except your good self so you need to address that
can i also say as a former journalist and this is terrible that i am saying this in public i was brought here and to the commission on many occasions and the grey walls and the dull presentations did not stimulate my european genes
you need to tackle that issue
finally if the irish government had as you said listened better explained better and gone local there would have been a yes
