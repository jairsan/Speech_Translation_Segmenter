mr president i had thought that after twelve years in this house nothing could faze me any more but i was shocked by the tone in which mr brok introduced his report yesterday
what shocked me was not the arrogance or the disconnection from reality or even the disdain for public opinion but the flagrancy
he said in so many words that we have had to avoid the usual treaty revision procedure because otherwise it might have triggered a referendum in some member states there you see unsheathed the contempt for the voters that the elites of europe now habitually display
public opinion is treated not as a reason to change direction but as an obstacle to be overcome
i cannot help being reminded of mr brok's countryman's words following the rising in east berlin
would it not therefore be easier to dissolve the people and elect another in their place
