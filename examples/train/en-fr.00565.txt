madam president i notice that at least some of those who have been denigrating all european legislation whatever it is nonetheless voted in favour of the third maritime package a package that i welcome because it increases the health and safety of people on ships it will ultimately cut costs because it will save lives downstream and it makes safety systems of different member states compatible with each other thus making them more efficient more effective and less costly while at the same time improving health and safety
i welcome the adoption of this package which will make a difference to the safety of hundreds of constituents of mine in yorkshire and humber
