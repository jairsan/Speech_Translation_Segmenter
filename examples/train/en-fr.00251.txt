mr president it is clear that following last year's toy safety scares and recalls in the run-up to christmas our current toy safety law drafted in nineteen eighty-eight cannot deal with the new risks and threats to children's safety
twenty years on eighty of toys in the eu and ninety-five in my own country are imported from third countries predominantly china
twenty years on we are better informed about the risks and hazards of certain chemicals and substances
twenty years on the design of toys has changed with toys containing powerful magnets and more electronic components using lasers and emitting more noise
that is why the toy safety scares and recalls were a wake-up call for europe to radically review update and strengthen the standards of our toy safety law
our new law will do more to reassure parents that the toys on our shelves are safer not safe but safer
importers not just manufacturers will be responsible for ensuring the toys they bring into europe meet our tough new standards
the fact is that manufacturers are banned from using harmful substances in toys such as lead cmrs and fragrances which can provoke or trigger allergies in children
we have toughened up the rules on choking and suffocation risks
we have introduced clear and more effective warnings on toys
the law will only work though if it is enforced and that is why it is good that we are giving more power in this law to twenty-seven member states enforcement bodies to demand all the necessary information they need for any operator in the supply chain and where necessary to conduct raids on premises
in addition all the eu's enforcement bodies are legally obliged to cooperate and share information to tackle the risk of unsafe toys
my congratulations therefore to mrs thyssen
thanks to the good cooperation with the commission and the french presidency we have done three things
we have met our deadline in the ep resolution last year of voting in a new toy safety law before christmas two thousand and eight
i believe that if we wait any longer the legislation would not be any better
we can give parents confidence that toys on sale in the eu will be safer in future and we are also sending out today a strong message to manufacturers brand owners and importers that they must meet our high safety standards or there will be no place for their products on our shelves
by voting for this law we say clearly that we are not prepared to tolerate toxic toys and dangerous toys in europe
