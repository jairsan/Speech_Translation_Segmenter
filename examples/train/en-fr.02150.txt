madam president i will be brief although i do think mrs lulling's idea of cross-pollinating speaking time across the groups is certainly one to be further considered
i will echo comments about the beekeeping sector but i would remind colleagues that the wild bumble bee population across europe is also in a similar and very grave situation
they are just as important for biodiversity and the pollination benefits that we have heard of very correctly about the honey bee sector
i would pay tribute to the work of the bumblebee conservation trust in scotland covering the bumble bee population across the uk
commissioner i would pick up on question four an excellent question suggesting that the commission bring bee diseases into the veterinary policy
this has been a long-standing call of this parliament and it strikes me that this is not just about doling out money but about sharing best practice and knowledge across the union
a lot of scientists in a lot of places are working on this and the commission could play a very powerful role in pooling that information and working out how much we know about this connected and very serious problem
