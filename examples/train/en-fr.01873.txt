madam president since being elected in nineteen ninety-nine i have done my utmost to galvanise opposition from this parliament to the massive catalogue of injustice that mugabe and his henchmen have inflicted on the people of zimbabwe
i have to say this is one area where this house speaks with one voice
today we are discussing the systematic abuse of workers in the diamond fields of zimbabwe by government security forces
zimbabwe is a full member of the kimberley process the informal body that governs the global trade in rough diamonds and which so far has taken little action to stop such abuses
i call on the kimberley process to consider tough measures against zimbabwe for non-compliance and i join the condemnation of the recent arrest of farai maguwu a man of conscience who dared to expose the violence perpetrated by the zimbabwean security forces at chiadzwa
the zimbabwean government must immediately release mr maguwu and for that matter all other political prisoners and we should recall that the right to free speech was one of the main commitments made by all parties in last year's global political agreement
at the moment the basic medical and food needs of a large section of the zimbabwean population are met by international aid
the zimbabwean government should use the substantial revenue that diamond mining is likely to generate to create a diamond trust fund to kick-start the economy and to provide the health education and social funding currently provided by international donors
regrettably zimbabwe still has a long way to go before we can say that its people live in freedom and democracy and under a respected rule of law
it is time for a dramatic change and the eu and the countries of southern africa should be bringing more pressure to bear to bring about good governance in zimbabwe
