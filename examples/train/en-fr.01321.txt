mr president i have to say there are people who do and there are people who talk
i therefore want to congratulate the council the commission and the high representative on the action that they have taken
none of this was foreseeable
we are looking at something that was unimaginable
i have sat here and listened to cheap political points being made against the high representative against the member states and against the commission via the notion that somehow because it is an american hand rescuing someone from the rubble and saving a life that you should brush that hand away and say no neo-colonialism and that somehow by attacking haiti itself you make the lives of the people who are suffering there better
shame on you
let us make sure that we coordinate
give the coordination over to the americans if it saves lives it saves lives
forget the political rhetoric
congratulations on committing this amount of money
congratulations baroness ashton on not playing to the audience and using up air space to get into haiti just to go there and show that you are there
what does that do
it does absolutely nothing
therefore angry on behalf of those people who want rescuing let us coordinate with the americans
let us kick the butt of the united nations so that it delivers aid and let us stop making cheap political points
