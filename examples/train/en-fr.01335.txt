mr president brevity is the source of wit
congratulations madame joly congratulations commissioner
parliament puts at its heart in these negotiations reinforcing the principle of non-negotiable human rights clauses and sanctions for failure to respect such clauses inter alia with regard to discrimination based on sex racial or ethnic origin religion or belief disability age sexual orientation and towards people living with aids and hiv
i am told commissioner that some member states do not want this amendment but for parliament it is vital
human rights as you well know are often far too eroded and this erosion is primarily for party political advantage
the defence of fundamental rights is at the heart of the european union and so it should therefore be at the heart and the centre of our relations with all acp countries
commissioner this is probably the last time you will appear before us in your present portfolio so can i please say a warm thank you on behalf of parliament
you have been a staunch defender of human rights and the values of the eu and i wish you well in your new portfolio
thank you
