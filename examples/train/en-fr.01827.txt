the commission is aware of a number of studies concerning the combined effects of different chemicals
in particular at the end of two thousand and nine the danish authorities published the results from a number of studies that examined the cumulative impact of different endocrine-disrupting substances on sensitive groups such as young children and female workers as you mentioned in your question
the danish study gave rise to the council conclusions adopted in december two thousand and nine in which the commission was asked to examine how current eu legislation addressed the cumulative effects of different endocrine disruptors and more broadly to look at the general problem of how to deal with the cumulative effects of these types of chemicals
concerning the general question of the cumulative effects of chemicals the commission recently made available through the internet a state-of-the-art report on mixture toxicity which was the result of the two-year study funded by dg environment
the commission is now engaged in consulting stakeholders on this report and has also submitted a formal request concerning mixture toxicity to the scientific committee on health and environmental risks the scientific committee on emerging and newly identified risks and the scientific committee on consumer products
by early twenty twelve at the latest the commission will on the basis of the study and the associated consultation process finalise a report assessing how and whether relevant existing community legislation including reach adequately addresses risks from exposure to multiple chemicals from different sources and pathways and on this basis it will consider appropriate modifications guidelines and assessment methods
since the launching of the community strategy on endocrine disruptors in nineteen ninety-nine we have invested heavily through the community research budget to increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which substances affect the functioning of endocrine systems
over the same period we have included specific measures to address endocrine disruptors in two key pieces of chemicals legislation reach and the plant protection products regulation
the commission has also participated actively in international initiatives to develop testing methods and testing strategies for the identification of endocrine disruptors
finally the commission has recently launched a major study to consolidate all the latest scientific information and to make recommendations concerning testing strategies and criteria for the identification of substances with endocrine-disrupting properties
the study will be finalised by the second half of next year
the results from this study will be taken into account in reviewing the existing community strategy on endocrine disruptors and to provide input to the implementation of the existing eu legislation by which i mean both the plant protection products regulation and also reach
so in summary the commission is aware of the seriousness of the questions you both raised and it is working intensively to address it in the most effective ways
it is not an easy thing because a lot of knowledge is still missing but it is certainly a complex problem which deserves our attention and utmost consideration in the future
