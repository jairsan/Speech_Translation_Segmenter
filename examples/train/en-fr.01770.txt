mr president doubtless the twenty twenty strategy says lots of interesting things but under enlargement by twenty twenty five new countries will have joined the eu and more likely eight
already in the eu of twenty ten twelve countries are net contributors to the eu
the other fifteen member states are subsidised
none of the new countries are likely to be contributors
in twenty twenty therefore there are likely to be no less than twenty-three countries being subsidised
by twenty twenty therefore the eu will have become in practice a transfer union which transfers money from twelve contributing countries to twenty-three subsidised countries
unfortunately and unfairly the uk taxpayer is caught up in this
the comparatively impoverished uk is the second largest contributor to the eu budget
at the last provincial elections in germany the voters of north rhine-westphalia said no to their coalition and were also saying no to the transfer union
voters in other contributing countries will also say no in the next ten years
by twenty twenty the gap will be unbridgeable
it is not in the uk's national interest for there to be economic chaos across the channel but unless enlargement stops forthwith economic chaos is what there will be
the twenty twenty strategy therefore misses the point
