madam president this poverty-stricken ex-colony has suffered decades of political instability and crisis resulting in profound and prolonged suffering for its citizens
its transition to democratic rule and better times for its people appeared a promising prospect after the two thousand and eight legislative elections were carried out in an apparently fair and peaceful manner
however the dark clouds of divisive hate and violence appeared again over the country after the shooting of president vieira by renegade soldiers on two march the day after the killing of the chief of the army
we condemn both those murders and we can only hope that the rival parties in guinea-bissau will find the necessary will and power to resolve their disputes through dialogue at the negotiating table for the sake of their citizens well-being
in addition as guinea-bissau has in recent years evolved into an important drug-trafficking country we urge not only the country's authorities but also the international community to do their utmost in fighting effectively this deadly curse
