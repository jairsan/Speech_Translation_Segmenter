madam president my group is committed to protecting human rights but we are not convinced that allowing the eu to sign the convention is wise
given that every member state is already a signatory to the convention what benefit is there to the eu signing as well
i should be very pleased if someone in this chamber could give me a practical example of how the human rights of one of my constituents will be better protected as a result of the eu signing the convention
at present member states are not required to make the convention directly applicable within their domestic law
i want to be reassured that if the eu signs the convention that position will not change
i do not want the power of the british parliament to change the way we decide to protect human rights to be undermined
my suspicion is that one of the motives behind this proposal is a desire to enhance the status of the eu to show it is a player on the international stage
in my view that is a very good reason not to permit the eu to sign the convention
