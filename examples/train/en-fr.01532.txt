president barroso many countries around the world have finely worded bills of rights in their constitutions
rather fewer afford genuine protection to their citizens
do you agree that what matters is not the structure of protection of rights but rather how that protection is practised
in the united kingdom we face a general election within three months
if elected the conservative party will repeal the human rights act and replace it with our own bill of rights
this would mean that the european convention on human rights would no longer be directly applicable in uk domestic law
president barroso will you explain to what extent plans for the eu to sign the european convention on human rights will take into account the differing positions of the member states
my party will also seek a treaty change to guarantee that the charter of fundamental rights does not affect the uk
how will you ensure that the eu does not interfere with the uk's right to opt out of those structures we do not wish to participate in
