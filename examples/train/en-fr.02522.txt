mr president like many colleagues here and i thank the rapporteur for his report i want to focus on the mercosur trade talks because for us in northern ireland they have the potential to destroy and particularly the livestock industry
on friday i met representatives of the agri-food processing industry in northern ireland
agri-food in northern ireland represents sixteen of gdp it represents tens of thousands of jobs it has been recession-proof it has grown even in the most difficult economic circumstances and for the future it can be the cornerstone of a dynamic economy and an expansion of the private sector
it is this that the liberalisation of trade and particularly the mercosur talks puts in jeopardy and with it the tens of thousands of jobs and the livelihood of many of my constituents
