yes you know we have proposed education as one of the targets in the eu twenty twenty including fighting against early school leaving and having more tertiary education
we believe it is impossible to discuss european competitiveness without addressing the issue of education
that is why we are trying to convince all member states to accept that target and certainly afterwards there has to be a mobilisation of resources some from member states and some from the european union
we have to discuss afterwards the financial perspective
we are not yet there but certainly i think some actions should also be taken at european level complementing the efforts made by the national governments
indeed in the social fund we already have some actions for young people for apprenticeships and for traineeships
this is our intention
we cannot anticipate what funds will be available for the social fund but certainly we believe that we should have adequate ambition at the european instruments level
