european union aquaculture is at the forefront of sustainable development
the commission and i have to admit that the aquaculture sector deserves greater recognition of its assets and values
the commission therefore adopted a communication entitled building a sustainable future for aquaculture which identifies three strategic objectives for public authorities to pursue promoting the competitiveness of the aquaculture sector maintaining its sustainability and improving its governance
in this communication the commission identifies a number of measures to be taken by public authorities at all levels eu national and regional in order to address the challenges faced by the sector
in order to support the sustainable development of european aquaculture including shellfish production the eu has in place comprehensive animal health and food safety legislation
we are very active at international level in establishing animal health and food safety standards for aquaculture products including shellfish that are essential for international trade
the commission has also established an eu reference laboratory for mollusc diseases which receives annual financial support to ensure coordination of national laboratories in the member states and provide scientific support to the commission
the commission with the concerned member states is also closely monitoring the abnormal mortalities observed in oysters over the past few years and has taken measures to control the virus that seems to be associated with these mortalities
as far as the overall strategy for eu aquaculture is concerned the commission would also like to recall the debate held in parliament in june twenty ten based on the report prepared by guido milana
the commission appreciates parliament's support for sustainable aquaculture and for giving it a greater focus
the commission is of the view that sustainable aquaculture activities should be adequately supported through the common fisheries policy and that this aspect should be covered under the reformed common fisheries policy
the commission is convinced of the need to help the sector organise itself more efficiently
in particular we want to strengthen its producer and inter-branch organisations so as to better link production forecasts to market needs and ensure higher value for their products through marketing and labelling
