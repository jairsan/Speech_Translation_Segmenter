mr president many in this chamber have been involved in the politics of sri lanka and indeed the politics of the diaspora of sri lanka and of the tamil community
what we are discussing today is a report by the secretary-general's panel of experts on accountability in sri lanka
i have not heard anyone in the chamber as yet cast doubts on the intrinsic integrity of that report
i have read the report and i have spoken to many about the report on both sides
if we are saying that we should leave the report on the table and we should not have investigations into what happened between january and may and indeed not open the door to investigate many allegations on both sides what is the point of a report of this nature
indeed i find it compelling that one diaspora organisation of the tamil community the global tamil forum has said that credible allegations against the ltte and they have made this very prominent should also be investigated
we have a report which ought to have a follow-up and i speak firmly in favour of the need for a genuine process of accountability which would bring truth justice and reconciliation to sri lanka following what will be a painful investigation but an investigation which must happen
