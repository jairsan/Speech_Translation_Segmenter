mr president i think in finding reasons for the economic recession we find ourselves in the finger is pointed and rightly so at bankers builders regulators speculators etc
i think however the area of public procurement has led to a lot of the problems as well where there was an element of jobs for the boys a lack of transparency and a lack of integrity
the contracts went inevitably to the same people all the time who of course time and time again went over time and over budget but were never penalised
i welcome these new developments that will allow us to have the greatest possible transparency in the process
however we also need to ensure that those who are sitting in judgment on these contracts have the greatest expertise and the greatest independence and are not appointees of the parties in power
finally i want to say that simplification is of course vital because there is no point in having too much time and too much money taken up in a very important but after all a preliminary exercise
