madam president commissioners can i say to you that less than a year ago we were debating in this chamber what we were going to do about global food security and was there enough food in the world and we were terribly worried about it
here we are less than a year later debating this legislation tonight which has the potential of actually reducing food production in the european union and there is a morality about producing food because what you must remember is that if we in europe do not produce food we can probably pay for it but the developing world cannot
much of this legislation will affect our crops not only wheat as robert sturdy has said but potatoes in particular
we have had two of the worst summers that i have ever seen in the last two years in northern europe
we have needed fungicides to reduce blight and actually grow the potatoes
and if people in europe do not eat potatoes what do they eat commissioners
they eat rice and they eat pasta both of which and certainly rice the developing world is very short of
further to what robert sturdy has said many of these pesticides and fungicides we are using if they are used properly and you have the proper withdrawal period pose no problems and by using these particular chemicals we can produce very good food
and if you stand and tell me that you will stop imported food coming in that has been actually sprayed with these particular types of chemicals you will not for the simple reason that if they had been properly applied you can actually test your wheat as much as you like as it comes through the port of rotterdam but you will find no residue there
so i think we really do have to wake up to the fact that we in europe need to produce food and we need to produce it safely make sure that we reduce the amount of chemicals we use which we are already doing and we have got to make sure that we are training farmers to spray properly which again we are also doing
so i would urge you please have a proper impact assessment because it was two years ago you did your impact assessment
we have had two of the wettest summers on record it is time for you to look again
we really do urge you to have a proper impact assessment
