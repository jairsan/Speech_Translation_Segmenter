it is true that the revised draft agreement was today adopted unanimously by the commission
we believe it is subject to strict compliance with safeguards on privacy and the protection of personal data
it ensures the principle of necessity and proportionality and its purpose is strictly limited to the prevention investigation detection or prosecution of terrorism and terrorist financing
the agreement as it stands now respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the charter of fundamental rights
the agreement secures significant safeguards for the data when processed by the provider
it provides also for transparency of the use of data and the availability of a process for seeking judicial redress
the commission therefore considers that this draft is compatible with respect for fundamental rights and will give appropriate answers to parliament concerns as expressed when the resolution on the interim fifth agreement was voted in march twenty ten
