madam president may i start by thanking the presidency-in-office for their opening comments comments that were far-sighted balanced and sensible adjectives that we have come increasingly to associate with the czech presidency
may i also thank commission president barroso for his remarks particularly to remind us of the importance of jobs and especially of the need to focus on those unfortunate people who do not yet have one
finally both of them referred quite rightly to the excellent work of all three rapporteurs but i would just like to single out their reference to mr silva peneda's report because they called it ambitious and far-reaching
it is and it needs to be because of the importance of this particular subject
mr silva peneda gave us various priorities for what we must do
can i just add a couple of things that ideally we should not do
we need to avoid two things in particular one is over-rigid labour markets which paralyse opportunity promote unemployment and simply encourage the black economy
we see this particularly at the moment in spain and we have to learn the lessons of the socialist failures there
secondly we need to avoid exclusive concentration on protecting those still in work at the expense of those who seek it and those employers who seek to provide it
these are the groups who really need our help
finally can i say that all of us clearly have different views on all sides of this house but one thing we have in common is that we all care about the issues which is why so many of us have been overrunning our speaking time
i am delighted we are having this key debate
i personally am delighted that my final speech as coordinator my final speech in this plenary should be on such an important subject
may i wish all those colleagues who are returning every good wish and may i particularly single out stephen hughes
one day stephen you will miss me and i shall certainly miss you but even when i am not here i shall be watching you
