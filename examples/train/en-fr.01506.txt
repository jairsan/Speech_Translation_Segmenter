mr president the reply received recently by president buzek from prime minister netanyahu justifying his refusal to allow this parliament's delegation to enter gaza last december requires a robust response
he is free to object to our meetings with palestinians in gaza and east jerusalem but he has no right to prevent them nor indeed to interfere with this parliament's democratic rights
high representative ashton must pursue her intention vigorously to visit gaza she must press israel to end the siege and the humanitarian crisis which goldstone has described as illegal collective punishment of the population
finally i want to welcome the agreement on proximity talks but i am seriously worried that escalating tensions around religious sites in east jerusalem and hebron could destroy the possibility of progress
i believe high representative ashton should act to de-escalate those tensions
