mr president as a representative of london a city that has repeatedly been a target for terrorists in the past forty years i have a great deal of sympathy with sri lankans of all ethnicities
the relentless terrorist campaign waged by the tamil tigers severely blighted the development of that beautiful country
president rajapaksa came to power democratically determined to defeat the ltte and his success should be congratulated by all of us who despise terrorism
the government now has the responsibility of building a post-conflict society with liberty justice and equality for all sri lankans
returning the idps home and trying the war criminals must now be the government's priority
while i concede that president rajapaksa may have lost some international goodwill through some of his emergency actions in the immediate aftermath of the conflict i am convinced that the best way forward is to guarantee the development of a secure and prosperous sri lanka and support its democratically-elected leader and government
the eu must maintain the gsp trade agreements which if removed will directly destroy one million jobs and indirectly economically impact on two point five million innocent sri lankan citizens
