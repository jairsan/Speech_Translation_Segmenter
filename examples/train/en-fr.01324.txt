mr president last summer i got elected to the european parliament by voicing criticism against my own government
a young woman in iran having done the same would have likely been killed imprisoned tortured and raped since
thanks to new media we have all seen the clips of the brutal way the iranian regime cracks down on citizens who speak out peacefully for democracy and freedom
recent arrests of human rights reporters by the intelligence office of the revolutionary guard show that the iranian regime takes an increased interest in closing off the country
their reports were heavily relied upon by international journalists
yesterday was martin luther king day
we commemorate a man who too marched the streets peacefully and said a time comes when silence is betrayal
high representative this time has long arrived
president barack obama broke off his holidays over christmas to speak out against yet more brutal attacks on citizens after ashura
in the proposed two-track approach to iran balancing the nuclear question and human rights the united states is increasingly emphasising human rights
europe should take a stronger leadership position here not only when it is politically safe to do so
the disaster in haiti is a terrible tragedy and i am glad you are taking action
however the man-made disaster that is ongoing in iran has not been met with leadership and coordination from the european side thus far
last month a delegation of this parliament was supposed to visit iran but the regime did not want us to see with our own eyes its own weakness and division
it is high time that europe takes one stance regarding iran and the world is waiting
is iran's current regime which has lost its legitimacy and is divided internally a credible actor in negotiations
what measures do you propose in the nuclear question that will target the government without harming the population
are you willing to call an emergency talk in europe on iran
to ensure that human rights will remain europe's priority how will you use the eu instrument for human rights
i believe we need to support citizens civil society and journalists
the shelter city programme proposed by the czech presidency might be a useful tool to support iranians under threat in europe
in the hearings with commissioner kroes i asked her whether she is willing to work with you to make free speech on the internet an integrated part of europe's foreign policy
i ask you the same
