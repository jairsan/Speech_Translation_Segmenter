mr president i fought hard to prevent the premature closure of units three and four of kozloduy
their closure several years ahead of time was not necessary it was certainly not on safety grounds
the effect as predicted has been increased use of environmentally unfriendly lignite-fuelled power stations an increase in electricity prices and a cut in bulgaria's electricity exports in other words both economic and environmental damage
we are now paying for mistaken judgments within the european union institutions
it is only right therefore that bulgaria should be treated at least as well by the european union as other countries that have had to close prematurely their ageing nuclear facilities and i am glad that the commission recognises this
a lot of money of course is involved in this decommissioning process
it is vitally important that these funds are properly and efficiently spent and accounted for
i hope the commission can give us assurances on this
it is also important to address the issue of compensating for and replacing lost energy capacity
bulgaria will need assistance in creating sustainable new capacity that ensures security of supply and diversification so that bulgaria is not reliant on the goodwill of one foreign power
