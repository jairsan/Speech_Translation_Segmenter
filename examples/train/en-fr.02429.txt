madam president there is a credible sounding justification for each one of the four financing instruments being presented to parliament today
however taken together their collective aim is to advance and promote the political and foreign policy agenda of the european commission
the commissioner made that very clear earlier with his customary precision and clarity for which i must thank him
we all know by now who is going to be paying for this the hard-pressed taxpayer and obviously and as usual disproportionately the british taxpayer
the exact cost of these financing instruments is still unknown despite the best efforts of my colleagues yesterday and first thing this morning
the commission is once again being profligate and irresponsible with other people's money and this is why we will not be supporting either proposal
