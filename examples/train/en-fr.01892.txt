mr president thank you for your clarification on the one minute but can i just take this opportunity a point of order
i was one of the authors of the first oral question
i am not at all happy that we now have a joint debate with two questions merging
i have tried since may to get the mercosur question on the agenda
i do not believe it should be a joint question and i want to make my opposition to what has happened this morning absolutely fulsome
i do not know how this happened or why this happened
i am extremely unhappy about it
can i come back to this in the debate
i would like a clarification please and i hope other colleagues will support me
