mr president it has now become clear on this tragic of days that draconian austerity measures will be imposed on greece to preserve the euro
this cannot be right
it simply penalises the ordinary hard-working greek people for the profligacy of their politicians and the desire of those same politicians to prop up the doomed currency union
we in the uk remember our exit in september nineteen ninety-two from the exchange rate mechanism the erm or as the british politician norman tebbit called it the eternal recession mechanism membership of which had been disastrous for britain
we escaped thanks to the bundesbank's refusal to prop up sterling
tough love does work
whilst it remains in the eurozone greece has no way out
free the greeks from the shackles of the euro
let the imf do its work and watch how quickly greece recovers as we in britain did on leaving the erm
do not make the greek people pay the price for the unattainable ambition of an eu superstate
