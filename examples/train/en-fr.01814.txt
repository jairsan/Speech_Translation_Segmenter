you have raised many questions
first of all what we are doing now in the task force and indeed in the commission a communication on twelve may already mentioned this is examining the possibility of reinforcing the stability and growth pact including by broadening the arsenal of incentives for compliance as i prefer to call it
i believe it makes sense to have these incentives for compliance some people speak of sanctions because we need the credibility of those instruments to ensure that the stability and growth pact is respected
as we have seen the problem was that some member states did not respect the treaty that they themselves had adopted and ratified
how can we do this
we want to do it in a fair manner not just penalising those countries that are in the cohesion fund
that is why we are looking for ways of implementing those incentives for compliance irrespective of whether or not the countries are cohesion countries
those incentives for compliance can be reinforced in several ways for instance more upstream including using them in the preventive part of the pact or more consequently for instance with an increased degree of automaticity
we are looking at several ways and the commission will put forward some legislative proposals on this
