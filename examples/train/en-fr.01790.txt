madam president i condemn the brutal repression by the thai government and state against the protestors in bangkok and elsewhere in thailand
despite propaganda that these were terrorists in the main they were in fact impoverished farmers from the north and around bangkok sections of the urban working class and their families who saw their protest as a struggle against the enormous poverty and hardship that they suffer
unfortunately these oppressed people look to the billionaire and former prime minister thaksin shinawatra for a solution
despite some populist measures against poverty when he was in government mr thaksin represents the capitalist elite and deceives the masses
on the other side there is the current prime minister abhisit and his party who represent other sections of the elite
i think the poor rural masses and the urban working class in thailand urgently need their own independent organisation to fight for their rights and i hope that the next mobilisation in thailand might be a united struggle of workers poor farmers students and youth dedicated to overthrowing all corrupt elites and bringing the major wealth of thailand into public ownership and democratic control and in a socialist thailand transforming the lives of its people and also fighting for the rights of all minorities
