mr president corruption has been an important cause of the crisis with powerful companies and powerful individuals misusing policies institutions and funds for their private benefit
the challenges of corruption do not disappear with development it only becomes more sophisticated
so far domestic efforts have not been effective in all member states
we should not ignore this reality we should recognise it
we have reached the moment when the commission and the council must establish as a matter of urgency a solid anti-corruption mechanism in the union and the member states
any delay will hurt the interests of european citizens
