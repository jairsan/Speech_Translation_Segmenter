mr president the european union has in my country and elsewhere too a richly deserved reputation for taking its decisions furtively secretly and surreptitiously
one would suppose therefore that the commission will do its best now to be open and transparent
instead the commission has produced this proposal i think it is ten forty-nine part of which actually restricts access to documents that are currently public
beyond this there is an important objective point which i remember from my time at harvard university and it is this decisions that are made without transparency and no proper public scrutiny have a built-in tendency to be bad decisions
you should accept that one of the reasons that the commission puts forward so many ill-considered ill-thought out inappropriate and ill-drafted proposals which we in england and other countries have to put up with is the lack of transparency
so in the matter of this legal framework i would urge the commission to think again if thinking again is ever actually a possibility for a flawed institution in a flawed system of governing
