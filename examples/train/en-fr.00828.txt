madam president i think the debate tonight well illustrates the difficulty of this issue and it also illustrates therefore how wonderful it is that we have been able to reach some form of compromise
as with all compromises somebody or everybody will perhaps be a little disappointed by something or other
i guess what i wanted to emphasise is what we have tried to say throughout our negotiations that what we have dealt with is what the internal market can deal with and that is the trade
we cannot deal with the hunting from here not the hunting that occurs in third countries
it has been difficult many of us still have questions about how things will be implemented and commissioner i am grateful for the reassurance you have given with regard to how the indigenous communities will be dealt with that will be something which will be important to many and something that we will have to watch very carefully
i think many of us still have concerns about the legality and there has been much spoken about this either at wto level or within our own internal market rules
suffice it to say at this moment that i would just wish to say thank you to the lawyers of all three institutions who have worked to get us where we are today
i suspect they will have more work to do in the future but that as i have said is for another day
so there we are we will see what the vote brings tomorrow
i believe that it is a compromise that is worthy of our support a compromise that honours the original written declaration and honours the views of european citizens
i hope that they will not be disappointed if they see that this does in any way infringe the rights of others elsewhere
it is that that has bothered me throughout the most and i hope that you will do your best commissioner to make sure that those small and fragile communities are protected
