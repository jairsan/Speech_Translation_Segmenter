mr president i think that we can all be proud of the swift progress made on this file which has been conducted under extreme time pressures and in a difficult legal context
the eighteen month prolongation of the transitional regime regulating the movement of pets into five member states will give them the time to adapt to the regime which applies in the rest of the european union
i have also confirmed that the commission does not intend to propose a further prolongation of this transition time
at the same time it will allow the commission to prepare a comprehensive proposal aimed at revising the regulation in its entirety and in particular bringing the old comitology provisions into line with the spirit and the letter of the lisbon treaty
i have to agree that this is an important file for european citizens and i am pleased that we have had a successful conclusion
