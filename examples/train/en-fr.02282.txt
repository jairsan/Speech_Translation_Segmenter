madam president most ordinary people see crises as tragedies
eurocrats see them as opportunities to extend their tentacles of power
the european council is to decide on a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole backed up of course by treaty amendments
we are reliably informed that these controls and of course these treaty changes will apply to non-eurozone countries too
the coalition government in the united kingdom has promised a referendum in the event of any further transfer of power to the european union
however this promise will be as reliable and as honestly followed as the conservative pledge to hold a referendum on the treaty of lisbon
for conservatives promises are tactics not obligations
