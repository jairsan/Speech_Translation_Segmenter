mr president this directive has taken concrete steps to consolidate patients rights in accessing healthcare services across the eu
i have taken an interest in this directive as the implementation will have a particular impact in my constituency of wales where despite the uk government negotiating with the eu on health matters the subsequent management and delivery of healthcare is a devolved competence delivered through the welsh assembly government
my initial concerns are at the potential impact on the welsh healthcare system regarding reimbursement and prior authorisation have been resolved as a degree of flexibility has been built into these proposals
the ability for member states and regional pairs to have the capacity to decide on eligible treatments with prior authorisation and a setting of a cap on reimbursements will go some way in alleviating concerns about the already overstretched and burdened healthcare systems
as a result of the work of my colleagues in this parliament past and present especially mr bowis we can be content in having taken a step forward in ensuring clarification for patients improved healthcare choice and greater cooperation between the different eu healthcare systems
this should lead to a rise in standards throughout the eu through patient choice
