mr president i fully agree with the concern that your question raises
in fact there is now a risk that because of the budgetary constraints in some member states some commitments are not respected
the commission had a meeting some days ago in addis ababa with the african union commission and one of the points raised by our partners in africa was that sometimes they feel that commitments are not respected
so it is question of credibility and accountability also on our side
so certainly the commission will defend the fact that we should keep our commitments
for instance the commitments taken in terms of fast-start financing for the fight against climate change
i intend to go to the high-level event in new york
just today i received a letter from secretary-general ban ki-moon highlighting the importance of this agenda and we fully share his concerns
i will raise the issue not only in the european council this week but also in the g twenty and g eight outreach meetings the week afterwards in canada
so we remain very much committed to this
i participated in the gleneagles g eight summit several years ago and in fact the reality is that the most developed countries have not yet fulfilled all that they committed to do
