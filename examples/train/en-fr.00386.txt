mr president i would like to thank the commissioner for her comments tonight in support of this initiative
last july i had the privilege the obligation and the humbling experience to attend on behalf of the president of our parliament the memorial ceremony at srebrenica
it has marked me
it is something i will never ever forget
thousands of people gathered in the hot july sunshine dignified sad a ceremony of memorial of remembrance and of course of grief
but we must remember because we all of us as europeans have a sense of déjà vu about potočari a sense of complicity
we all saw on our tv screens the scenes before the massacre before the flight to tulsa
we have that helplessness and hopelessness that we perhaps shared
we can never say never again but we can say that we will remember we will learn and we will help people to move forward
that is what this european day of memorial should be about
i will never forget what i experienced
i will never forget the mothers the daughters the families that i met over that period
i hope that we can deliver something lasting and positive to them for the future
