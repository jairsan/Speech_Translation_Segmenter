mr president the ecr group supports the need for an eu common external energy security policy based on solidarity between member states but energy mix must remain a member state competence
we must of course diversify away from overdependence on russian oil and gas of which even the uk traditionally dependent on the north sea and norwegian gas is now an importer
we must develop the southern corridor and should consider the white stream project in addition to the nabucco project as a priority but also with trans-caspian and even trans-saharan routes as exciting future prospects for the european union
we need better gas-storage capacity in europe and more integration of our pipeline and electricity grids
in the uk we are keen on new nuclear power stations as well
i welcome investment in renewables including the desertec solar project which combat climate change as well as aid diversification
we also need better energy efficiency though the recent eu ban on incandescent light bulbs is draconian ignores the health hazards to the skin and the environment from the mercury and makes the eu needlessly unpopular in my country
