mr president my group has signed and will support this resolution
i am not saying we agree with everything in it but we endorse the core passage
i want to put this to both commission and council and will read out the headline that we have agreed a bold single market act and small business act to create jobs
now where are the jobs going to come from
they are going to come from private investment enterprise and new business start-ups
we already know that small enterprises have been the main engine of job creation over the last decade
my message to both the commission and council today is that all twenty-seven member states have got to start taking job creation enterprise seriously at the level of the single market
we all believe in the single market and member states have invested huge amounts of money and resources in opening up the services market but have they told their businesses about it
have they promoted the single market
have they encouraged enterprise
have they encouraged online trading
why do they not get down to doing these practical things to unleash the power of what we already have alongside all the other projects that my colleagues have talked about
they need to start on that tomorrow today even rather than talk about some of the other longer-term projects
they should get down to work
