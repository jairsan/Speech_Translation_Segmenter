mr president this report is about active dialogue with citizens and the best kind of active dialogue with european citizens is one based on listening to what they say in democratic votes
there is a great irony in this parliament adopting this report whilst at the same time completely ignoring some of the democratic decisions that have been taken in member states
no wonder the european union is so unpopular in my constituency of north-east england and elsewhere in europe
its idea of democratic dialogue is only one way the eu does not listen to what people have to say and only tells them what they can think and how they can vote
looking back over the past ten years france the netherlands and now ireland twice have all voted to put the brakes on greater european integration and yet the eu has completely ignored their opinions
by seeking to listen only to those eu-funded ngos how can that be reflective of popular voter opinion
the best kind of dialogue with citizens is to listen to what they say in free democratic votes and referendums
