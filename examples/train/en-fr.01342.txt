mr president recent events have once again reminded us all how important it is that we share information in order to ensure the security of eu citizens
swift has been a valuable tool in achieving this
luckily having met with us government officials particularly mr david cohen the assistant secretary for terrorist financing in the us treasury department recently in washington i was reassured by the multi-layered control systems and safeguards and independent oversight which i hope will lead to the implementation of this new agreement being beyond reproach
where i must express grave concern as others have done is in the council's substandard consultation with parliament and alleged commission delays
it is essential that parliament and the elected representatives of this house are frequently and properly informed and parliamentary consent must not be a retrospective tool
for the council to treat it as such undermines the values and democratic principles that lie at the heart of this chamber and this parliament
i do hope that the council and indeed the presidency will take careful note of these remarks
