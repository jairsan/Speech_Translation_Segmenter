mr president we know that the united kingdom is protected by the protocol but the validity of protocols is a question that goes beyond the subject of a single currency
there is a protocol providing the uk and two other countries with opt-outs from the charter of fundamental rights but the commission's own legal service has suggested that the opt-out is at best of limited application
might the protocol providing the uk with an opt-out from the single currency also be of limited value
