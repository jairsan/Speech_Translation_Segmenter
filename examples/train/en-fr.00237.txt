mr president the recycling sector in the european union has a turnover of eur twenty-four billion and employs about five hundred zero people
it is made up of sixty zero companies and the eu has around fifty of the world's share of the waste and recycling industries
however this sector is now in crisis as a result of the collapse in the price of recycled materials on world markets and it is becoming economically unviable for waste businesses to continue to operate
given the importance of this sector for sustainable consumption and production in the eu i would like to urge the commission to implement without delay the recommendations set out in the report by its own taskforce on recycling which was compiled during the preparation of the communication entitled a lead market initiative for europe
