madam president as a former health care professional of over thirty years it was distressing to learn that parliament would not be consulted regarding the commission's new proposals on alzheimer's disease
however we must move on
as europe's population becomes older the impact of alzheimer's will become deeper too
the number of alzheimer's cases worldwide is predicted to grow from thirty-five million today to one hundred and seven million cases in twenty fifty
one of the most harrowing aspects of alzheimer's disease is the many people it affects apart from the patient
in ireland for example there are fifty zero listed carers to cater for ireland's forty-four zero sufferers
this disease is often called a family disease because of the chronic stress of watching a loved one slowly decline
the further role of the european parliament in the fight against alzheimer's disease should not be discounted
any new direction by the eu should take account of parliament's unique voice on the matter and should move to assist not just alzheimer's sufferers but also the many carers who work to increase their quality of life
