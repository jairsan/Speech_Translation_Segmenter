commissioner malmstr√∂m i think never has the phrase poacher turned gamekeeper been more appropriate and i always welcomed working with you on these issues
i think what you said is somewhat encouraging in that it signals some strengthening in the oversight and mechanisms that the commission will have for the future but the fact is that there is the past
member states participated in illegal cia rendition torture and disappearance and there was a lack of oversight and accountability
there was a lot of rhetoric about human rights just as there is now but a huge gap between rhetoric and reality
we still do not have a full calling to account
are there things that the commission as guardian of the treaties can think of that could still be done not only to try and make sure that member states respect their obligations in the future but how we can still get investigations including i very much hope a proper public inquiry now under the new uk government to make sure that we know fully what happened in the past and what went wrong
