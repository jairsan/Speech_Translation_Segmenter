madam president i congratulate elisabeth jeggle for her good work in this report and for her continued work in this area over the number of years i have known her
it is a compliment to her work that there are no amendments tabled to this important report
in the short time i have i want to draw attention to several paragraphs in it
i welcome paragraph four about the importance of an adequate budget for agriculture in general and paragraph ten about new technologies in rural areas and the need to widen the access to broadband
i think paragraph thirty-four is particularly important
women ought to be adequately represented in all political economic and social bodies in the agriculture sector so that decision-making processes are informed by both male and female perspectives
that is really important and i regret to say that the face of farm organisations is unfortunately all too male
we do need to look at that issue
lastly the commission needs to be aware that the problem for male and female farmers at the moment is the uncertainty over the debate on cap reform
i worry that some farmers are trying to second guess the outcome of those reforms and that they may be taking on additional costs which will be a burden to them
i would ask you to bring that message to the commission
