mr president i supported the resolution on the evaluation of the eu-belarus dialogue
i voted yes because i welcome the increased high level eu-belarus dialogue including bilateral contacts and the intensified technical cooperation initiated by the commission
at the same time i would like to point out that the political dialogue between the eu and belarus must be conditional on and directly connected to the lifting of restrictions on freedoms and cessation of the repression of participants in peaceful demonstrations and human rights activists
i insist that the democratic opposition in belarus and civil society be included in the dialogue between the eu and belarus
last but not least i hope that the government of belarus will use the next nine months to achieve substantial progress in a number of areas including freedom of association and the granting of political rights and freedoms
