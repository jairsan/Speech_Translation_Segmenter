mr president many people are under the misapprehension that if we adopt the position proposed by alejandro cercas they will not be able to work an additional hour of overtime beyond the forty-eight hour average each week
that of course is not true
we are against the opt-out in principle because this is health and safety law but we have proposed the twelve month averaging of working time rather than the four-month current averaging period
this gives phenomenal flexibility for individuals and firms in the planning of working time
in fact so much flexibility that the council itself looked to put in a fixed limit of sixty or sixty-five hours per week depending on the averaging period
we did not do that
the amount of flexibility included here is far better than the use of the opt-out it is a far better choice for firms and for individuals
i hope that message goes out very strongly from this debate
