i would like to ask the minister if his attention has been drawn to the protectionist elements in the plan for recovery in the united states particularly as put forward by members of the house of representatives and the senate and if he has on behalf of the council communicated the concern of the european union to the american administration about this
this does not augur well for a new doha round
would he ensure that our concerns are communicated before the necessary legislation passes through the us congress
