madam president how can mrs ferrero-waldner refer to russia as a partner and mr vondra seek assurances on democracy and human rights
russia is a gangster state where troublesome political opponents dissenters and journalists are simply murdered
the russians even have a law that allows them to murder anyone russian citizen or foreign national on foreign soil whom they deem to be a threat or a nuisance
such a murder was carried out on my constituent alexander litvinenko in london in two thousand and six in an act of state-sponsored terrorism
his family are still waiting for justice to be done and his murderers brought to justice or trial in england
personally i do not want the european union to negotiate agreements with anyone on anything
but if the commission is serious why did it not request the extradition of the suspects as a sign of goodwill and a precondition for opening negotiations
