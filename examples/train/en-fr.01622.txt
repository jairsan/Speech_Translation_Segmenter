mr president may i also thank mr scott√† for the work in this important report
i want to refer specifically to amendment four which asks for the maximum amount of information to be made available to the consumer
it also supports the introduction of comprehensive and compulsory legislation for place of farming labelling
whilst these are laudable aims i believe the amendment is too restrictive and would perhaps be better as a voluntary piece of information
in northern ireland we rely heavily on the ability to export produce to the rest of the uk and other european countries
this amendment has the potential to affect northern ireland's ability to sell products in certain markets where currently there is no difficulty and i feel that it is important that new labelling does not create barriers which prevent trade between different member states
whilst amendment four poses some difficulty i recognise the important work of the report and i recognise the importance of producing traceable high quality and safe products
