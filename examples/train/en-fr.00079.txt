mr president the critical issues that affect fishing in the outermost regions seem to be the same as those that all fishermen face only they are more amplified
there is a very real threat to the future of these fisheries piracy discards dwindling stocks etc
ageing vessels and fleets but for them these problems are even more of a burden because they are already very vulnerable
we need to help our most remote fishing communities to maintain not just their livelihood but their skills which they have honed over generations and which without protection are in danger of being lost not just to them but to us
we must all take heed of the changing socioeconomic needs of these outermost regions taking into account the impact which they are experiencing in their sector
in order to help them survive we must allow them more participation in their management as well as specific measures like the extension of time for fleet renewal
