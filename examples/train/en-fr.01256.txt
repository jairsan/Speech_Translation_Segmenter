i am not yet at the stage of discussing the financial perspectives and i cannot anticipate what britain's contribution will be
i understand the concern that you are expressing because at the present time british taxpayers are paying the biggest contributions because of what happened in the financial sector in britain
there has been no other case of such large state aid as that which we have seen in your country
the point we are at today is the following we believe it is important to set priorities for the future to see what we have to spend at national level and what we have to spend at european level and then to have a discussion about the fair way of sharing that investment
however we believe that in some cases it makes more sense to spend a euro at european level than at national level because of the potential benefits of exploring the european dimension and the european internal market
we will come to that discussion and i hope at the end we will come to an agreement
