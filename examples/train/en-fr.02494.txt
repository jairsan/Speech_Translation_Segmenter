mr president considering the enormous importance of developments in egypt to the whole region and eu relations with that part of the world it is very important that we show our timely attention and interest and take a pro-active role rather than a reactive one
when a nation egyptian or any other comes together to claim its right to democracy the eu should offer to help its people to transform their dream into reality
taking into consideration that the constitution is suspended parliament dissolved and presidential elections scheduled later this year it is very important to ensure that free and fair elections are granted in this country
people will exercise their right to free media and freedom of expression
at the same time we face a risk that if elections are held without the foundations of deep democracy being laid then yes it is possible that extremists will triumph
