mr president i am just curious to hear this argument that somehow national parliamentary ratification is not legitimate because if that is the case let me just take the example of my own country which has never ever in the whole of its history ratified an international treaty by means of a referendum
in that case if it is illegitimate for the national parliaments to ratify a treaty then the nato treaty the united nations treaty the world trade organisation every commitment that britain has ever entered into by means of an international treaty is equally illegitimate
so i do not understand this argument that national parliamentary ratification is somehow undemocratic
