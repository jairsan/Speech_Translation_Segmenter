mr president last week in the united kingdom lord davies delivered his speech to the government on how to increase women's participation in the boardroom
his report consisted of voluntary targets for businesses
no one can disagree that we need more women in the boardroom
what i cannot accept is that we need quotas to get there
how patronising is that
almost as patronising as giving the women in this room a rose when they came in
well i gave my rose to a man
on a positive note the uk is making real headway in the elimination of the gender pay gap
the latest figures show that the pay gap between men and women in full-time employment is down to ten the lowest since records began
finally on international women's day i must pay tribute to motherhood
true equality is having the right to choose and not be judged for these choices
whether a director in the boardroom surgeon in the hospital part-time care assistant car mechanic or housewife and mother a woman has the right to make her own choice
