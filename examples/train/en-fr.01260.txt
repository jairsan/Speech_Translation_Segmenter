mr president there are two commitments which i specifically want to welcome in the council statement and which have the potential to create a new dynamic support for the palestinian authority's two-year programme for ending the israeli occupation and establishing the palestinian state and the union's readiness when appropriate to recognise a palestinian state
last week i led an official european parliament delegation to the occupied palestinian territories where once again i saw with my own eyes the apartheid system being implemented by israel against palestinians along with the dispossession and destruction of their homes their lands their water and their places of worship
within hours of the publication of the council statement the permission my delegation had for going to gaza was rescinded
that is not the act of a friendly state
it is certainly an interference in the democratic right of this parliament to have decent and democratic relations with our opposite numbers elected by the palestinian people
we found widespread despondency and hopelessness amongst the people we met and in the areas we visited in hebron east jerusalem and ramallah
where there is hopelessness there will be violence
we can make progress now or we can let the situation slide into more bitter violence which will drive moderate palestinian politicians out of leadership
that is the choice we have to make
i would appeal to both the council and to baroness ashton whom i wish well to reinvigorate the union's engagement with this process not just looking towards the quartet to reinvigorate its engagement with the process and to put in place a timetable coinciding with the palestinian authority's two-year timetable for the implementation of the principles we outlined so bravely in my view last week
we must vigorously defend human rights
we must act
we must use access to our markets to incentivise israel
i am not talking about sanctions
i am talking about ensuring that access to our market is used as an incentive to ensure that israel acts in relation to its international responsibilities
we must also finally persuade the united states to urgently re-engage on the same basis we outlined last week
