mr president the key strategy the eu commission has for europe up to twenty twenty is reliance on neoliberal capitalism and a market system in other words the exact same factors that have plunged the world into the current economic chaos and illustrated in the commission's and eu governments response to the financial crisis in greece a shameful capitulation to the speculation and profiteering by the sharks in the financial markets demanding that the greek working class pensioners and poor should have their services and living standards savaged to feed the insatiable greed of these financial markets which are not some kind of an all-powerful god as media commentators would have us believe but investment banks hedge-fund operators bond holders and the like parasites seeking super profits by deliberately speculating to create financial instability and then exploiting that to bleed working people
is this the europe we want for twenty twenty
it is pathetic to hear mr barroso appeal to them for responsibility ask a shark to give up its taste for blood the fightback by the greek working class should be supported by workers all over europe
we have to break the dictatorship of the market
that will be done not by idiots burning banks but by sustained and mass mobilisations and strike action of working people and replacing this diseased system with democratic socialism and a real human society to be created by twenty twenty
