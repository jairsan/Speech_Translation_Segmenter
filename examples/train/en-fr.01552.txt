mr president as chairman of the committee on the internal market and consumer protection it gives me great pleasure first of all to say how much we all appreciate the fact that commissioner barnier and commissioner dalli are both here today as a number of my colleagues have observed and secondly also to remark that i think this is a remarkable occasion for parliament
we have one committee that has put together three own-initiative reports focusing on monitoring and implementation of key legislative instruments and as you commissioner barnier have said part of your success will be judged not just in the number of legislative proposals you bring forward but how well they are working
i think this is a really significant development that all committees in this parliament need to engage with
i want particularly to thank all the coordinators on the committee who have worked with me to move forward in the work that we are doing and also to engage national parliaments to have forums of national parliaments
i very much hope as both commissioners indicated that we would have a wider internal market forum but we would like to have your reports brought together so this can become an annual event in parliament for this really important subject
i think it is significant if we look at the eu twenty twenty proposal that the completion of the single market is now relegated to a paragraph that says missing links and completing networks
well i hope all my colleagues agree this is absolutely not acceptable
the eu twenty twenty initiative is calling on member states to contribute and we have heard from the rapporteurs whom i thank greatly for their reports about the fact that member states need to contribute to the completing of the single market
this must be a flagship initiative and not relegated in the way that it is in the eu twenty twenty initiative and i hope that both of you will help us to make sure that that happens over the next few weeks
