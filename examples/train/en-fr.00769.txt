thank you for that follow-up question
rebuttal forms part of our regular activities at times and it is also part of what our representation offices do
of course candidates or different stakeholders can always turn to us to ask for factual information and to also provide replies to these kinds of statements being made
but i think the commission will probably play a role in providing factual information rather than being a party to the debate which i think is for the political parties and for the candidates
but we will always try to offer factual information and that is something that we do on a regular basis
