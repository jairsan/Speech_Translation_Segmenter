mr president saved from the ashes left by the bush administration by the election of obama the transatlantic partnership is no longer sufficient to solve the main challenges faced by humanity but it is still necessary
europe must take advantage of this opportunity and articulate with the us the exit strategy for the current global crisis upholding human security and that does not only mean reforming the international financial system but regulating the whole globalisation process and investing in a sustainable economy at the global scale
we need more and stronger europe to help obama close guant√°namo end the secret prisons and to define an alternative strategy for the security challenges in afghanistan pakistan iran and sudan and put in place justice and peace for israelis and arabs
we need a stronger europe and a genuine partnership with the us to achieve the millennium development goals
only with an eu capable of sharing the burden and assuming its global responsibilities an eu which is not just the sum of its parts will we be taken seriously in washington be able to influence the policies of the obama administration and be in a position to enable the genuine transatlantic partnership that the world still needs
