mr president this proposal is based on the assumption that all persons from third countries entering the eu are persons of good faith and that if they say they are coming here to study they really are
the eu is rich in bogus colleges and even genuine colleges frequently have students on their books who never appear in a lecture room
if their movement to other states is facilitated it will be much more difficult to check the genuineness of their status and more difficult to locate them when their status is found not to be true
although the uk is not in the schengen area the eu has a track record of regularising illegal immigrants
today's holder of a long-stay visa or a residence permit might be tomorrow's illegal migrant and the day after an eu citizen with complete freedom of movement
