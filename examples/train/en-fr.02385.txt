mr president i welcome mr orbán
after the six months farce of the belgian presidency it is nice to see an elected prime minister from a proper country
how i enjoyed your denouncement of communism as a dangerous ideology and i noted the pride that you took in the fact that hungary was the first country to take up arms against the soviet union
twenty years after you won back your ability to govern yourselves democratically you are now part of a new political union that increasingly shows similarities with that old soviet union
in fact you are going to meet lots of communists over the next six months including the boss of the commission here old barroso who was an advocate of chairman mao you will see centralised economic planning and control and above all what you will see is the desire to impose a political union upon the peoples of europe without their consent
wake up mr orbán
look at how they are trying to bully you this morning
they are trying to tell you how to run your own country
tell them where to go
stand up and fight for democracy once again
