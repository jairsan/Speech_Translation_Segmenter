i have an additional question
in the european parliament we are currently working on the future european investment policy
when it comes to russia we often hear about the expansion of russian companies in the european market especially in the energy sector but at the same time european investors face enormous difficulties when they want to invest in russia especially in sectors that russia deems as strategic such as the energy sector
so how is the commission going to ensure that the principle of reciprocity in the investment relationship is upheld in the new partnership agreement
