madam president coming from ireland a country that also suffered a tragic famine over one hundred and fifty years ago i understand the ukrainian desire to have the victims of their artificial famine from nineteen thirty-two to nineteen thirty-three commemorated
this resolution of parliament follows previous commemorative resolutions from other international organisations such as unesco and osce
our resolution on the commemoration of the victims of the holodomor in ukraine was adopted at the thirty-four session of the unesco general conference which was supported by ireland among others
at the madrid osce ministerial meeting in november two thousand and seven thirty countries associated themselves with ukraine's statement commemorating the seventy-five anniversary of the holodomor
european integration must continue to be based on a readiness to come to terms with the twenty century's tragic history
this present european parliament resolution makes an important call on countries originating from the soviet union to provide full access to archives on this tragedy for comprehensive scrutiny in order to unveil and fully investigate the causes and consequences of this famine
present-day relatives of the victims are seeking closure and should therefore have the right to access such information in order to come to an understanding of the greatest catastrophe in ukraine's modern history
i add my voice to this expression of sympathy to the millions of ukrainians that suffered this calamity and in particular to the relatives of those who died as a result of this artificial famine
