i am extremely proud and happy that catherine ashton has been designated as the first vice-president of the commission and high representative
it is an appointment that i very much supported and approved during the european council
of course we all know her well as someone who has both the political skill and the sense of direction to take on the demanding task of high representative and vice-president of the commission
we all know that this in an innovation
it will take time for all of us to learn how to use new arrangements to deliver the best results in terms of the european union's increased role in the world
what is clear is that we will only achieve this by a real partnership between institutions
that is what the double head is designed to provide and what i am determined that the commission will offer to have the best possible role in the world
of course i am extremely happy that she comes from britain i think it is essential that britain remains at the centre of the european union and also that she is a woman because as you know i have been very committed to the gender balance
so for all these reasons and also because she is my colleague in the commission i was as you can imagine extremely happy with that decision
