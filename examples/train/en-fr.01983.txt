madam president last year i met the son of haythan al-maleh in brussels
he was seeking support for the release of his father
mr al-maleh has a distinguished history as a human rights defender and jurist and has been a frequent critic of the al-assad baathist dictatorship in syria over the years
mr al-maleh is a sickly elderly gentleman and should be released on humanitarian grounds not that he has committed any crimes except falling foul of the emergency and repressive laws against dissidents in syria that have been in place for more than forty years
syria sadly is a problematic state harbouring known terrorists having suspicious arms dealings with north korea including possible nuclear ambitions and being close to that very roguish state iran on political grounds
i appeal now to the syrian leadership and its president to improve its deplorable human rights record and release mr al-maleh
