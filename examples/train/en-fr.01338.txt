i speak tonight because as has been mentioned two constituents michael turner and jason mcgoldrick are imprisoned in unit two of the central budapest jail in hungary
they have been imprisoned since three november and they are yet to be tried
there is in fact no trial date
the terms of imprisonment are burdensome
they are separated and have no contact with each other
they share a small cell with three other prisoners
they are confined to their cells twenty-three hours a day
they are permitted three telephone calls and one shower a week
they are allowed one family visit per month
in short they are isolated
the language barrier makes the isolation worse
they are accused of a white-collar crime
they are not murderers or terrorists
and they are imprisoned only because of the european arrest warrant
the european arrest warrant swept away at a stroke the safeguards against arrest established in britain over a thousand years
well may you shake your head mr watson it would be better if you apologised
mistaken identity and identity theft mean that what has happened to jason and michael can now also happen to any british citizen at any time
the labour party the liberal democrats and the conservative party all voted in favour of a european arrest warrant
to restate zola i accuse the parties of the british political establishment their support for the european arrest warrant has put everyone in britain at risk of random arrest
