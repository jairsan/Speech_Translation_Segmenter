madam president it has been an interesting debate
i should just like to point out however that there is a crisis of confidence and perhaps the president of the commission should acknowledge this very deeply
there is a crisis of confidence in democracy because the public believes that there has been a failure of elected representatives to regulate financial markets and all markets
i think we have to acknowledge our weakness in this respect
there is a belief that the european union can do better than individual member states and that is certainly a strong belief in the member state i represent ireland where we are in the depths of an economic and banking crisis which requires deep analysis and scrutiny
unemployment is the biggest problem we face here and if we now have strict enforcement of the stability and growth pact i worry about the impact it might have on employment with increasing numbers of young people disillusioned and in a state of crisis because of the situation
i welcome your comments on food security biodiversity and sustainable growth but be careful that doha and bilateral trade agreements do not destroy those noble objectives
