mr president the eu heads of mission report on east jerusalem makes pretty devastating reading
let us not beat about the bush
this report makes clear that what is going on in east jerusalem amounts to a form of ethnic cleansing
palestinian homes are being stolen people are being forced out and hopes of peace are being destroyed
so the question is what are we going to do about it
the council's conclusions are very welcome
we know they are strong because the israeli government immediately dismissed them
nothing new they said
they are used to dismissing our words because we never back them up with deeds
they treat us with contempt
why shouldn t they we are so gullible we actually pay the bills for the occupying power we keep the palestinians going when it should be israel footing the bill not our taxpayers
if our words are to have meaning then we should suspend or threaten to suspend the association agreement but not one of our foreign ministers has ever even raised that possibility we are told
so the question remains where is the policy
well we have the policy
it is in the conclusions
now what about the action
israel will not move unless it is pushed
