madam president i am presenting together with my colleague l치szl칩 andor the decision which the commission has taken to present a new framework for national roma integration strategies
the eu framework comes at a moment when the situation of roma has become a real focus of attention in europe
the eu has made available to the member states a range of legal policy and financial instruments to address the situation of the roma
we also have a whole legal framework based on non-discrimination free movement of people and the enlargement strategy
however it is very clear that the economic and social marginalisation of the roma persists and this is neither acceptable nor sustainable in the european union of the twenty-first century
parliament with support from across the whole political spectrum and i would like to underline this has drawn attention to the urgency of promoting the integration of roma through its recently adopted resolution on the eu roma strategy
i would like to thank the rapporteur mrs j치r칩ka for her excellent work
determined action is needed both at national and at european level
we need to join forces and step up our efforts to end discrimination against roma and make sure they enjoy the same rights as any other european citizens because that is what they are
when i say that i of course have in mind a two-way process which requires a change in the mindset of the majority of our european citizens and of members of the roma communities
we all agree that there is a need for effective policy planning and implementation as well as for a strategic common approach
we all know that the primary responsibility for the integration of roma lies with the member states
we also acknowledge that the situation of the roma varies greatly from one member state to another
that is why the commission decided to present an eu framework to enable the member states to take action commensurate with the challenge they have to overcome
the roma task force which was set up in september last year and reported in december showed clearly that very often not enough is being done
the eur twenty-six point five billion which are available under the structural funds are not being utilised as they should be
only eur one hundred million of this money was earmarked for specific roma activities while seventy of the means for technical assistance which would have been necessary in most member states was simply not used
so the measures in place so far are not adequate
it is now time to ensure that national regional and local policies focus on roma needs in a clear and specific way
in our framework we concentrate on four main issues education employment health and housing
we want the eu and the twenty-seven member states to commit themselves to closing the gaps and to concentrate on the common goals in those four areas with targeted actions and sufficient funds to deliver them
we want all member states to build these goals into their existing roma strategy if they have one or to develop a roma strategy if they do not have one for the period up to twenty twenty
in order to check whether these efforts achieve their objectives we need regular monitoring
therefore the eu framework lays the foundations for a robust monitoring mechanism to ensure concrete results for the roma
this monitoring mechanism will ensure that the national roma strategies are implemented that money intended for roma integration reaches its final beneficiaries and that there is progress towards achieving the roma integration goals
the commission will report annually on progress made towards integrating the roma population in the member states
the eu framework provides an opportunity for all stakeholders at all levels to join forces with the eu population in general and the roma population in particular in order to put an end to the exclusion of more than ten million european citizens which we can no longer afford for the future
