mr barroso i am confused
help me
what is the eu's policy on libya
i got a letter on one april from the noble baroness ashton telling me that the eu had provided more than eur seventy-five million in humanitarian assistance and that although the situation remains uncertain the eu has offered to assist in fostering dialogue
yet she wrote this many days after the bombing had begun
that is what she has been saying
on the other hand we have got hard man herman van rompuy who has made it clear that regime change is the aim of this libyan adventure
he also said that the action in libya could not have happened without the european union and that france and germany could not have taken military action without first getting the support of the european council
so we have two big chiefs within the european union directly contradicting each other
could you please shed some light on the matter and tell us what is the european union's policy on gaddafi and libya
