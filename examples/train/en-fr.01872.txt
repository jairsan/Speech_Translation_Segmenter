mr president i would like to thank you and all your staff for all your patience
i must say when i first came across the idea of the cfp i thought the c in the cfp stood for communist rather than common fisheries policy
here we actually see the idea of central planning where central planners decide how much fishermen in each nation can catch and like communism it has been a disaster
it has led to a depletion of fishing stocks and ever more fishermen are complaining about the lack of quota they have been given
surely it is time to learn from the lessons of successful fish preservation and conservation
let us look at the property rights-based systems in iceland and in new zealand where as the previous speaker has said the coastal communities are looked after because they are given their rights in perpetuity which they can sell on they can trade or they can leave to future generations
surely that is the best answer because it has been a success and has conserved fish rather than the cfp system which has been a dramatic failure in europe
