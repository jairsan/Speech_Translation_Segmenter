mr president the eu supports the kimberley process which aims to eliminate african conflict diamonds or so-called blood diamonds from the global market
however recent developments in zimbabwe are worrying
the chairman of the kimberley process mr mathieu yamba from the democratic republic of the congo has decided unilaterally and without consultation to allow the marketing of diamonds from zimbabwe's marange mine
this mine which was debated in the house last year was seized by president robert mugabe and his cronies
hundreds of people were dispossessed of their homes and there are reliable reports of his security forces torturing raping and even killing local residents
the sale of diamonds from the marange mine will help mugabe to further consolidate his tyrannical hold on zimbabwe and indeed enrich his zanu-pf thugs
i therefore urge the european union as a party to the kimberley process to raise this scandal at the highest level and insist on the restoration of consensus-based decision making in the kimberley process
more generally i have long been calling for a similar system a certification to cover other natural resources extracted in africa in order to prevent brutal governments or guerrilla groups from selling minerals to fund arms purchases
i am pleased to be working alongside the london-based internationally renowned human rights ngo global witness in this endeavour in which the us administration is leading the way with the passing of the dodd-frank act
