mr president i think that this recommendation is a very good example of the added value that the european union can bring to health care where although we have limited competences bringing together experts from member states can really make a difference to peoples lives
as mr trakatellis said the figures that the commissioner spoke about on adverse reactions to medical care and on health-care-associated infections are quite shocking
nobody should go into hospital and come out more ill than they were in the first place and many of us will know people who have had this problem
it is a problem right across the european union and that is why it is extremely important that your initiative on health-care-associated infections should go ahead
i think that we have a lot to learn from each other and we can certainly avoid a lot of problems for our citizens if we work together to tackle this issue and bring the best heads in europe together
the second point i want to talk about is one mentioned very briefly in our parliamentary report and that is needle-stick injuries
i know the commission has been looking at this issue for a long time now and there is a cooperation between employers and trade unions on this issue but we still have a situation where an estimated one million workers in the health services across europe are affected by needle-stick injuries
this could be avoided if the needles they were using were replaced with a safer kind
i hope madam commissioner that you will be returning to the commission and that in the new parliament session you will bring forward a proposal on needle-stick injuries which is very important for many health-care workers and is a very avoidable problem in our health-care system
