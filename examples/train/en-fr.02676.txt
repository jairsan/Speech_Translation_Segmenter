madam president i do not like to be in tow or obligated to anybody and neither do the irish people an independent race
for that reason the recent eu-imf bail-out hurt the irish people badly
however i do not share the opinion that europe is to blame for it
it was largely due to ireland's incorporated banks regulator and government not the irish people but the irish people are now being forced to pay the price and the burden is too large
for that reason i would ask two things one the interest rate should be reduced and i would like to thank commissioner rehn and president barroso for their vibes in that regard
secondly i think bondholders will have to pay a price if not a haircut then at the very least they deserve a bit of a shave
individuals do not get a guaranteed interest-free investment and neither should bondholders
if those two things were done then we might be able to make progress
