mr president i understand that the original idea for the creation of pet passports came from the official monster raving loony party in the uk which probably best sums up this dangerous scheme
my country had a compulsory six-month quarantine period for domestic pets
under the eu pet passport system this important bulwark against the spread of disease was summarily removed
the unelected european commission was able to overrule the democratically elected british government and introduce a system without a quarantine period that relies on vaccinations and the accuracy of paperwork
as a farmer i know something about vaccination
it is by no means a guarantee against animals bringing diseases across borders
the effectiveness of the vaccination can be compromised by many things including its being administered to an animal that already has the disease it is being inoculated against
vaccinated animals can also be carriers of the disease without displaying a symptom
batches of vaccine of varying quality and forged paperwork is a real probability
i understand there is no standardisation of enforcement of the scheme
some countries require the formal passport while others will take documentation in any form still others will not accept the passport as proof of vaccination
many airlines are unable to provide details of the formal procedures and staff are poorly trained
in other words it is an accident waiting to happen
there is a saying in my country if it is not broken why fix it
such advice is wasted on the commission
