the employment guidelines are very much dependent on the overall economic growth but we intend to reinforce the employment aspect in our eu twenty twenty strategy
in fact we have four guidelines increasing labour market participation and reducing structural unemployment developing a skilled workforce promoting job quality and lifelong learning improving the performance of the education systems and increasing the participation in socio-education as well as combating poverty and social exclusion
these are general guidelines that now have to be pursued by the european institutions with all the instruments they have at their disposal and by national governments
it is true that there is no silver bullet there is no magical solution or panacea for unemployment in europe
it has to come also from the overall measures taken for growth in terms of respect for financial stability in terms of confidence in our markets in terms of tapping the potential of the internal market
that is the only way to do it
when it comes to the automobile industry of course we know that there was over-capacity not only in europe but in the world and we are following this very closely with the industry itself including with the trade unions in the sector
