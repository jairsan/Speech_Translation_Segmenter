mr president ever since i came to the european parliament i keep asking myself why switzerland and norway have not joined the european union and i wonder if it is because they have the best of both worlds
the benefits of being in the european union without the obligations
here today i am a bit dubious as well
the commissioner mentioned they will have to pay
of course they will have to pay but normally non-members pay more than members of clubs
however i will bow to the superior wisdom and experience of doris pack in saying that this may be the way forward
it may help create greater european awareness among the citizens in switzerland and they may one day join the european union
if that happens which i hope it will i think all the credit will have to go to the commissioner and doris pack for their enlightened approach
in this season of goodwill i am prepared to go along with the proposals
