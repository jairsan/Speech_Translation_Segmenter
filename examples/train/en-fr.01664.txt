just today in the work programme we have presented our action in the financial sector
we have done a big part of it but another important part remains to be done
i think the commission proposals were the right ones
in fact i regret that in some cases the level of ambition has been reduced by member states for instance regarding the supervisory framework that is now being considered by you in parliament and we will come forward with some proposals there is a complete list that i have presented today to parliament in the near future
but i think there are some specific things to be more concrete that we can do
for instance i am supporting the idea of a bank levy
i think that should be a matter for the g twenty
i think it is fair that the banking industry after all the problems it has created to the overall economic situation also gives a contribution for the future of our economies
so as always it is a question of balance
we do not want to undermine what is a very important sector in our economies the financial sector but we believe that some more measures are important to restore confidence in the financial sector
