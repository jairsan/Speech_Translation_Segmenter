mr president i was unaware of that i thought you could just wave at the appropriate moment
this had the makings of a great report
i drew up the opinion in the committee on foreign affairs
india is the largest democracy in the world it is now coming out from many decades of protectionism embracing global free trade it is surviving fairly robustly the global financial crisis
it would have been great to have achieved a deep free trade agreement between india and the european union which is also a very large democratic polity and it would also be a nail in the coffin to those who are saying that protectionism is the way ahead in global trade
so i deeply regret that this report was so amended by the socialists as to make it unpalatable and unacceptable to those of us who support free trade
india also deeply regrets that the government of india had stored a great deal of political capital in the idea of this agreement going through in a way that would have been good for india and good for europe
therefore we had to vote against it i am afraid to say
