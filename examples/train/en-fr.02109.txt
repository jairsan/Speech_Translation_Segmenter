madam president the livestock sector is an important traditional farming industry which represents the livelihood of thousands of producers across the eu
this sector is central to the socio-economic contribution made by agriculture to the rural areas of the european union
it is a key agri-industry in europe and even more so in ireland as ireland is the fourth largest exporter of beef in the world
in particular the high cereal prices exacerbate the problems for profitability amongst winter beef finishers who have a higher dependency on cereal-based feed imports
there are three issues in particular that i wish to highlight firstly the necessity that the commission put in place efficient and flexible markers and measures to curb extreme market price volatility
action is also needed to close the gap between prices paid by consumers and prices received by producers
secondly it is essential that the commission steps up measures to support the livestock sector in less-favoured areas in particular
the next cap reform must focus on the special vulnerability of certain livestock sectors and the significant production costs that farmers undertake
under the next cap the excessive bureaucratic burden on livestock farmers must be addressed and reduced
lastly european producers comply with the most stringent regulations in the world in terms of food safety and quality the environment and animal health and welfare
these high standards must not put them at a disadvantage in comparison to third country competitors
it is crucial for the long term viability of the livestock sector overall that the commission ensure that their actions on trade and agriculture do not compromise european farmers but support the sustainability and viability of the european livestock sector into the future
