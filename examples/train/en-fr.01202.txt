madam president over the last few years the commission has repeatedly highlighted its commitment to the internationally agreed decent work agenda including the promotion of ilo conventions
the commission has actively supported the member states and closely cooperated with the ilo with a view to adopting ambitious legal standards which meet the challenges of a globalised economy and contribute to the implementation of the ilo's decent work agenda
the council and the european parliament have underlined the importance of the decent work agenda and of the commission's activities in this respect
the eu member states have already ratified all ilo conventions covering core labour standards and a large number of other ilo conventions
the commission has reaffirmed its commitment to the decent work agenda as part of the renewed social agenda
in particular the commission called upon all member states to set an example by ratifying and implementing the ilo conventions classified by the ilo as up to date
in doing so the commission underlines both the internal and the external dimension of the decent work agenda
in addition where ilo conventions have involved exclusive community competences the commission has issued timely proposals for council decisions authorising the member states to ratify the relevant conventions combined with a call to ratify the standards as soon as possible notably the maritime labour convention and the work in fishing convention
finally the two thousand and eight decent work report provides for the monitoring of the policy developments with regard to the ratification process
the outcome of this analysis is expected to be reflected in the follow-up decent work report to be published in twenty eleven
