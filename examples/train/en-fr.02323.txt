let us leave aside for a moment the question of whether we should again be dragged into somebody else's problem let us focus instead on the main logical flaw here

my dinghy keeps capsizing so i would like to be put in charge of an ocean liner
my go-kart has crashed so please put me at the wheel of an articulated lorry

the eu is a solution in search of a problem but surely the day is coming when we can no longer impose ourselves both on the markets and on public opinion
the spell is breaking and the shamanistic incantations are losing their force
