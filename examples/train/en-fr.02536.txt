the common consolidated corporate tax base ccctb is an important initiative in removing obstacles to the single market and was identified in the annual growth survey as a growth-enhancing initiative to be frontloaded
indeed it will tackle some major fiscal impediments to companies competitiveness
at the moment the lack of common corporate tax rules and the divergence of national tax systems often lead to over-taxation and double taxation
moreover businesses are faced with heavy administrative burdens and high tax compliance costs
this situation creates disincentives to investment in the eu and runs counter to the priorities set in the europe twenty twenty strategy
significant progress has been made so far on the technical preparation of the ccctb proposal
it is now time to offer companies a single set of rules to make it easier and cheaper to do business in the single market
the ccctb is scheduled for adoption by the college of commissioners on sixteen march twenty eleven
i am convinced that the final proposal will greatly contribute to a better environment for businesses growth and jobs in the eu
