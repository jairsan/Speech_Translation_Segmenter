madam president the particular point i want to make is that on too many occasions we have seen the sanctuary of our free societies in the west abused by extremists who eventually return to their home countries hostile to our values and bearing revolution
yesterday was the thirty-second anniversary of the return to iran from paris of ayatollah khomeini
we know where that has led
rachid ghannouchi who has advocated the annihilation of the state of israel has just returned to tunisia after two decades in london
he regards the leadership of the palestinian authority as illegitimate he supports hamas
hamas of course is an offshoot of the muslim brotherhood the one well organised political group in egypt
such organisations build their power base by responding to the everyday needs of the people and they then consolidate their power through terror
we must take stronger measures to prevent the incubation of extremism in our own capitals and do more to reach out to legitimate civil society in places like egypt and tunisia with well focused assistance including well controlled financial assistance
