i understand your concerns about the situation in the car industry
from the start of negotiations with korea the commission has invested considerable resources in obtaining a good result for the eu car industry
european car exporters will benefit from a combination of the elimination of korean duties on cars and the effective removal of technical barriers
the most substantial barriers will be removed from day one of the agreement
