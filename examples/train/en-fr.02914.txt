madam president on a point of order i see over on the other side of the room that there are political posters displayed in the chamber
i believe this to be against the rules
it does not bother me personally but what i have asked for many times in this chamber is that there is an even application of the rules to everybody
if the ladies and gentlemen over there are to display their political posters then i wish to have the right to permanently display my vote ukip poster on my desk and for anybody else to display their posters
can we have a ruling one way or the other please
