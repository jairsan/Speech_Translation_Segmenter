i think the work done by the european parliament on this aspect has been extremely important in shining a light on the rendition programme and showing what has been happening
this has created momentum but also strong public opinion to find out the truth
as i said the commission has been urging and encouraging full in-depth investigations in the countries affected and will continue to follow up and ensure these are really being carried out
the single european sky proposal is there to help us to further monitor this
we will keep an eye on this and will continue to push for clarity
besides that there is not much concrete that the european commission can do but we are happy to work with the european parliament in order to continue to push for clarity and to make sure that this is not something that would be part of the european policy against terrorism
