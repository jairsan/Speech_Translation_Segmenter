in december two thousand and eight the poznań conference agreed on a work programme for two thousand and nine which clearly identified steps towards the copenhagen climate conference to be held in december two thousand and nine
poznań has also sent the message that the current financial crisis is not to be seen as an obstacle to further action on climate change but instead as yet another opportunity for transforming profoundly our economic system and moving toward a low-carbon economy
that being said we have to be aware that we will not have an easy time in doing so
the economic downturn will affect the willingness of the stakeholders involved to absorb additional costs related to the reduction commitments as well as mitigation and adaptation measures
the czech presidency intends to pursue efforts at international level towards a successful agreement in copenhagen in december
as you know as a follow-up to the commission communication called towards a comprehensive climate change agreement in copenhagen and on the basis of the input of the temporary committee on climate change set up by the european parliament the council adopted conclusions on this issue last week thereby further developing the eu position on a comprehensive post twenty twelve agreement
the forthcoming european council is also expected to agree key political messages
in addition to the shared vision of the long-term action on mitigation and adaptation as well as technology the identification of appropriate means for financing effective and long-term climate policies is key in the eu's position and will determine to a large extent the success of the copenhagen conference
the eu has already started to engage in active outreach not only with key negotiating partners and the main emerging economies but also with the new us administration which has already signalled its readiness to engage again in a meaningful way
the presidency has had its first meeting with the new us administration and plans to have further exchanges as soon as possible
climate change will be one of the topics discussed during the informal eu-us summit in prague on five april
the first signals coming from washington are in any case encouraging so it will be crucial to ensure good cooperation between the eu and the us in order for our positions to be as ambitious as possible and to ensure that consequently the major emerging economies will follow suit
for the eu's efforts to fight climate change to deliver it is absolutely crucial that we bring other major world co producing economies on board
it is for this reason that several of these countries have also been invited to the g eight meeting south africa egypt china india australia mexico brazil indonesia and south korea
as far as the climate and energy package is concerned by reaching agreement on this package in december two thousand and eight the eu sent a very strong political signal to all its negotiating partners in the world
now we will start its implementation which involves a lot of technical work
aware of the need to determine in further detail the criteria which the european union would wish to apply in deciding to move from a twenty to a thirty reduction the council is currently considering the issues of complementarity of effort and of the adequacy of possibly developing country actions on the basis of the commission communication
the relevant text is included in the environment council conclusions of two march two thousand and nine
