mr president when i saw the title of this report active dialogue with citizens on europe i thought it was a bit of a joke because the fact of the matter is we had active dialogue with the citizens of europe
the point about dialogue is that it is not a monologue you have to listen to what the citizens of europe say
the citizens of europe in the netherlands in france and in the republic of ireland have said very clearly in relation to the lisbon treaty that they do not want that treaty
if therefore this parliament and all the european institutions want to have dialogue with their citizens which is a good idea let them proclaim without any equivocation that it is dialogue which they will respond to and that they will listen to what the citizens say
it is an utter waste of time this parliament even debating or reporting or voting on the idea of dialogue if collectively and that is the truth about this parliament it refuses to acknowledge what is said to it and refuses to respond to it
that is its failure
