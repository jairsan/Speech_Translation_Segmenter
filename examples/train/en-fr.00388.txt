mr president it seems rather futile to welcome this motion for a resolution on gaza which of course i do because thus far words have not been heard above the noise and din of rocket fire bullets and the cries of men women and children who have been wounded and who have died in the region
but it may be that today there will be further movements towards a cease-fire in the region which would be most welcome
in that respect we support the efforts of egypt to broker a cease-fire
while egypt and the arab leaders may bring influence to bear on hamas when it comes to israel i think it is the us which carries that influence although i hope that this motion for a resolution which was resoundingly supported in parliament today will add further to the pressure for immediate and effective humanitarian aid for a cease-fire and for a lasting peace in the region
