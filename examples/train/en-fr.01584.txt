mr president i welcome this cross-party resolution calling for the release of israeli soldier gilad shalit held captive since two thousand and six by the military wing of hamas
i agree with gilad's father who has asked that his son's case be addressed as a humanitarian issue and not be turned into a political football
in the cut and thrust of political debate we must never lose sight of the suffering of both israeli and palestinian families whose loved ones have been taken from them in this conflict
the geneva conventions must be respected by all sides
it is totally unacceptable that gilad shalit has been denied his rights as a prisoner of war to which the goldstone report categorically states he is entitled
his family have no information on the state of his health either physical health or mental health
at the same time amongst the seven two hundred palestinian prisoners in israeli jails also held in breach of the geneva conventions one five hundred are held for an indefinite period and thirteen have already served twenty-five years
forty-four are children while twenty-three members of the palestinian legislative council are detained in retaliation for the capture of gilad shalit
again goldstone is clear these detentions of plc members are contrary to international law
i will raise these issues at the euromed parliamentary assembly in jordan this weekend
i urge catherine ashton during her upcoming visit to the region to press the israeli and palestinian authorities including those in gaza for the release of gilad shalit and of palestinian children and plc members and to ensure their safe and early return to their families
