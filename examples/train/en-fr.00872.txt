mr president our citizens expect us to provide real help for them in these troubled times
the european economic recovery measures before us constitute an important package and i applaud the strong emphasis on green jobs and technologies that will help reduce our carbon emissions and promote energy security
i am also naturally very pleased that my own country will be receiving up to eur five hundred million of financing to promote offshore wind energy and carbon capture and storage projects
however it is clear that the overall package proposed is lacking in both size and ambition
i would like to see more emphasis placed on youth unemployment
we need to give the younger generation hope for the future
nevertheless what we have here on the table today is without doubt better than doing nothing at all
labour meps will therefore support these measures although we are clear that a new economic recovery plan is needed
i hope the conservative meps present will also vote to support these measures in defiance of the do nothing approach of their isolationist leader david cameron who has consistently opposed labour measures in the uk which offer real help to those worst hit
