mr president when considering the authorisation of the food additive thrombin the commission's collaboration with all member states considered carefully all four requirements set out in the regulation on food additives
these are the safety aspect whether there is a reasonable technological need information aspects and advantages and benefits to consumers
as regards safety and hygiene efsa evaluated the product and concluded that this additive raised no safety concerns
as for hygiene i cannot share the view that in this case the risk of contamination is higher than other products for example minced meat
secondly the reasonable technological need for this product has been established
the enzyme preparation functions as a stabiliser in the final meat product
this technological function is explicitly described in the food additives regulation which was adopted by parliament
thirdly information aspects and in particular the major concerns expressed in the report that the product would mislead the consumer
because we are fully aware of the possible risk of this our proposal includes the following strict requirements which incidentally go further than what is usually required for food additives
firstly the product can only be sold pre-packed to the final consumer
secondly the product must carry additional labelling and the term combined meat parts must be mentioned in the proximity of the sales name
the consumer therefore will be well informed about the nature of the product
thirdly the name of the enzyme and its animal origin must be mentioned in the list of ingredients
i must emphasise that these labelling requirements are more stringent than the requirements that apply to products to which other ingredients such as blood proteins and authorised additives have been added for the same purpose but for which no additional labelling is required
if more stringent labelling requirements are indicated they will be considered
the enzyme preparation in question is already used in several member states as a processing aid without any labelling requirements
our proposal clarifies the situation and would oblige member states to apply the required labelling rules
as a consequence the consumer would be better informed
furthermore consumers especially those who need more support will benefit from the availability of cheaper meat products as better use is made of valuable meat pieces occurring during the processing of meat
this additive is in my opinion an example of a food-sector development which will benefit consumers
i see no reason for its suppression and hope very much that you will appreciate the entirely valid reasons i have set out as to why it should be approved
i have made a commitment to parliament i will not tell people what to eat
but i will tell them what they are eating
my position is in line with this commitment
