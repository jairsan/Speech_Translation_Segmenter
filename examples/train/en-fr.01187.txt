mr president i have said it many times before and i will no doubt say it again whatever the motives of its founders the european union has long since ceased to be an ideological project and it has become a racket a way of redistributing money from people outside the system to people within it
hence the thing we are talking about today these bungs to selected favoured companies
let us pass over the suspicious timing of the grant to dell in ireland that was announced with questionable procedural propriety in the run-up to the irish referendum on the european constitution or lisbon treaty
let us just make the wider point that we have tried this before as a continent in the nineteen seventies we went down the road towards propping up uncompetitive industries with disastrous consequences
we know where that road leads
it ends in stagnation inflation and ultimately in collective bankruptcy
let us not go there a second time
