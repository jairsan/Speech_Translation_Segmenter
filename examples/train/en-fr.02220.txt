mr president like many people we are just relieved that there is good news
while it is understated rather than overstated you have made progress in a calm way because we had lower expectations
i want to deal with one particular issue and that is reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation the so-called redd programme which is a very important issue but i am concerned about a lack of policy coherence in the commission in relation to this issue
for example the trade commissioner is currently trying to do a deal with the mercosur countries which will result in increased beef production in these countries
that can only come from land that will be deforested which will add to the climate change problem
i would urge the commissioner to bring this message clearly to the college and to address it in a way that shows us as acting in a coherent way as the european union
