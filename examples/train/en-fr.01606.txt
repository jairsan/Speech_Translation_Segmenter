mr president in times of economic stringency faced with cuts in public spending right across european countries all the eu's institutions should be looking at how to cut costs and waste
parliament should be taking a lead
instead it continues in a self-indulgent manner with its costs and staff numbers constantly increasing with no thought of constraint
in any other organisation new priorities would be met by compensating reductions elsewhere but not in this house it seems
meps bear the brunt of public blame but it is the overinflated bureaucracy needless excesses and the redundant buildings which cost the money
how can you continue to justify parliament's gbp ninety-four million annual self-promotion budget with eight million spent on the superfluous europarl tv and this bizarre scheme for a gbp two million house of european history
it is ridiculous that you maintain so-called information offices in every member state at an annual cost of forty million when it is the job of seven hundred and thirty-six meps to answer any questions their constituents may have
it is a continuing scandal that this parliament has not demanded that member state governments stop the strasbourg circus once and for all
we need to send a clear message to our governments on this and save two hundred million a year
