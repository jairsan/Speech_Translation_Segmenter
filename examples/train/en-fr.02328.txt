first of all you know the position of the european commission regarding israel
we fully support the existence of israel
as you said it is a democratic state in a very difficult environment and we fully recognise the right of israel to exist
at the same time we would like israel to respect the right of self-determination of the palestinian people and we believe the best solution is for two states israel and the palestinian state to exist in full respect of each other and of international law
regarding the issue of a change of capital or our representation in israel we see no reason to change it
