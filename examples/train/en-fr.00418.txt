mr president that issue of high electricity prices in ireland has been tackled by a colleague of ours formerly of this chamber simon coveney and we hope that he is successful in it
i voted in favour of this report because it talks about sensible issues like energy efficiency and energy security related to the climate change agenda
i have concerns about nuclear power as do many people in ireland but i think we need to acknowledge that when interconnectors are up and running we are likely to be using power generated by the nuclear sector
so yes we need research into the safe disposal of nuclear waste and into new developments of this technology to enhance the safety and security of it
in the absence of that i remain concerned and voted in accordance with those concerns in relation to this report
i particularly regret that amendment thirty-seven was rejected as i think it reflected very fairly many of the concerns of this house
