mr president once again the house has been treated to two speeches by the bnp and ukip and once again the two parties are united in their belief in conspiracy theories showing there is very little difference between them
but i want to congratulate the minister first of all this morning for remaining ambitious about copenhagen and sticking to the idea of a legally binding agreement
this morning the bbc is reporting that the white house is saying that it will come to copenhagen with targets for cutting us emissions
those of us who have met us members of congress know that there is a serious move afoot and thus a very serious prospect of legislation in the united states so i think there is still real hope for a deal in copenhagen
but copenhagen will just be the beginning because when we come back from copenhagen we in europe will have to continue our work to cut our emissions
we have got to keep investing in energy efficiency in renewables and in low-carbon technology
i am very pleased that last week we agreed as a european union that there will be investment in technologies like carbon capture and storage and that one of those plants will come to my constituency in yorkshire at hatfield
commissioner dimas i want to thank you
i do not know whether this will be the last opportunity on the floor of the house to thank you for the work you have done as commissioner over the last few years but the commission has really done a very good job in putting europe in the lead and your work has to be commended to this house
we will see you in copenhagen
we might see you here in january but i just wanted to put that on the record
finally i hope that this house will vote for a good resolution on climate change and i hope we will reject the amendments put down by members of the house on the opposite side who seem to want to water down our commitments
they want to reduce our targets and they want to offset more of our emissions
if we are serious about climate change if we want a good deal we have to vote those amendments down
