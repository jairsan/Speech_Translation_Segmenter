madam president those of us who believe in freedom individual liberty and the rule of law have for years sought to persuade our american friends to close guantánamo bay or the detention there
so the country that calls itself the leader of the free world cannot put aside those values for its convenience albeit understandable security concerns
now that president obama has announced the closure of guantánamo bay we should be helpful in any way we can
however it is not for the european union to determine who enters the european union countries
it should be for member states and let us call upon the member states of the european union to do their bit to help our american friends at this time
they have shown the will
they have listened to us
it is about time we listened to them just as the european political élite should listen to the voters when in referendum after referendum they have rejected the lisbon treaty
it is time for us to listen to the voices that count
