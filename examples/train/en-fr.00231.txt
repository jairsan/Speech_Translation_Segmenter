mr president as rapporteur of reports on the enp i have long supported israel's increased involvement in eu programmes and agencies which is mutually beneficial given israel's advanced status as a country in areas such as scientific and in particular environmental research
in recent weeks i have received many e-mails asking me to vote against this eu-israel enhanced cooperation agreement
however i believe that the eu and israel are natural partners because they share the same values democracy the rule of law and personal freedom and in particular a free press and independent judiciary
not all the eu strategic partners can say the same
china for example dear to the president's heart i know rejects those values but strangely i do not receive many pleas to downgrade the eu's relationship with beijing
that is because sadly the anti-israel element amongst the public and in this house remains strong
when that sentiment is based on reasoning i can respect it even if i do not agree
often though it is based on anti-semitism and anti-americanism as the us is israel's closest ally
last week in india jews were specifically sought out in mumbai to be murdered by jihadi terrorists
this demonstrates the need for the west to stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with the jewish state as israel is on the frontline of an existentialist battle with islamist terrorists such as hamas hezbollah and islamic jihad who have proved their determination to destroy israel and our way of life
the european parliament regrettably narrowly voted today not to give its opinion on this agreement dear to the incoming czech presidency which in my mind is disastrous and will send all the wrong signals to the israeli public during a critical electoral period and will inevitably strengthen the hands of hardliners in israel
