mr president meps have an important role to play in scrutinising decisions on health claims
i have received many letters and emails of concern from parents major health and consumer organisations midwives nurses and doctors organisations as well as unicef and the who
until there is real consensus in the scientific community about the validity of this claim we must not allow it
the evidence we currently have is not conclusive and no evidence exists to support the use of such a claim on follow-on formulas
if in the future synthesised dha is proven to be truly beneficial to babies we should make it an essential ingredient in all formulas and not allow it to be used as a marketing ploy by a specific brand
i would urge you to support this resolution
