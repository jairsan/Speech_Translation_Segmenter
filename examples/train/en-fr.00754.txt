mr president of course we are all in favour of lower charges when travelling abroad with our mobiles you would have to be insane to be against that but that is only one part of the equation
when we in this house oblige the operators to lower their roaming charges they have to find the money from elsewhere and that will usually mean raising the charges for those who do not travel
this is in other words a tax on non-travellers for the benefit of travellers
there will be teenagers in council estates in my constituency who are now facing higher charges so that a number of businesspeople meps and commissioners can talk more cheaply when abroad
i have to say we were not disinterested parties
all of us involved in this vote stand to gain very substantially from the kind of regulations that we have been pushing through in this field over the last year
if you want to understand how power has shifted in europe you need only read this report
who whom
asked lenin in perhaps the pithiest statement of political philosophy ever uttered
who has the power and over whom does he wield it
well there can no longer be much doubt over who has the power we do we eurocrats
