mr president stress tests on technical standards are not enough
it is not just about earthquakes
the problem in japan was the accumulation of events flooding loss of off-site power and disruption of communications
we have seen how one problem leads to another and that the very radioactivity of the site in fukushima now is hugely hampering the safety work which needs to go on
a nuclear accident is not a linear event the consequences ripple outwards like the radioactivity which is still discharging into the sea
it is therefore vital that the proposed stress tests take into account the multiple complex geometric consequences of a disaster event
commissioner as you say member states have the right to decide their energy mix but you have the responsibility for nuclear safety
do you agree that member states should impose a moratorium on the planning and commissioning of new nuclear plants
what will you be proposing to make sure that governments and investors focus instead now on how to get a greater commitment to energy efficiency and renewables
