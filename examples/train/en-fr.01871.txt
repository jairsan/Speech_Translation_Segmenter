mr president i think one can understand why when the political leaders of europe saw their war-ravaged countries at the end of the second world war they wanted to promote the idea of food security and the common agricultural policy
however if you look at the policy sixty years later let us look at the cost to the eu citizens
let us look at the fact that citizens pay three times once in tax to pay for the bureaucracy once in tax to pay for subsidies and then the higher prices that they have to pay in their shops
surely rather than talking about the reform of the common agricultural policy we should be looking to abolish it
scrapping the cap would allow efficient farmers to thrive
it would allow taxpayers to keep more of their own money and deploy that money more usefully and it would allow consumers lower prices
reform is not enough it is time to scrap the cap
