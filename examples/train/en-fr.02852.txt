mr president today the schengen arrangements are coming under strong pressure
on the one hand given the current wave of immigrants from north africa where the eu is encouraging democratic change some states have asked for and obtained a temporary suspension of those arrangements
on the other hand other states have decided for reasons which would seem to reflect their own narrow interests towards the applicants to exploit the fact that romania and bulgaria are not yet part of the area and to try to keep them out once again
consequently the rules of the game have been modified during the match to the disadvantage of the two players
i personally support the positive conclusions of the report and praise the author for them but although i can understand the political reasons for amending the recommendation the basis of politics is after all compromise i cannot ignore the fact that the new conditionality suggested might facilitate a subjective interpretation of it
i pray to god that i am wrong
