i would like to direct the minister's attention to the sustained campaign against the very tiny protestant community in turkey epitomised at present by the farcical trial which has been going on for some months of two young men turan topal and hakan <unk> who have been on trial charged with insulting turkishness
their crime apparently is the practising of their religion
with such a view of freedom of religion is it not clear that turkey has a very long way to go indeed before it meets the basic standards of human rights and of freedom of religion
