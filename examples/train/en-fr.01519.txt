mr president many colleagues have pointed out the necessity of having this review and the sooner the better
they have particularly mentioned the value to the consumer and that is absolutely correct but benefiting the consumer does not mean it is going to affect industry it can benefit both industry and the consumer
i particularly have in mind the fact that over the next few years we are going to have two million people passing the age of sixty in the european union
that gives a great opportunity to the industry to tap in to what those people would like to do in terms of travel particularly travel without hassle
if this directive is all-inclusive and offers full protection it is a great opportunity for the industry to tap into the over sixties in this european union which would be of great benefit to them
i think therefore that like the timeshare directive this can be seen as a win-win situation both for the consumer and also for the industry
