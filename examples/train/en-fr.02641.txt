madam president like mrs dodds i had intended to speak about the economy but the terrible callous murder of a young catholic police officer in northern ireland has sadly changed that
i think it is important that this house realises the enormity of this tragedy for the island of ireland and for the family affected by it
mr kerr had only finished his initial training in december he was only twenty-five and a bomb exploded under his car
i was very touched by the comments of his mother yesterday on mothers day when she urged catholics not to be deterred from joining the police service of northern ireland at a time when we are striving as she said for a neutral police force for the good of our country
she urged all catholics not to be deterred by this murder
she said we all need to stand up and be counted and to strive for equality
again i will quote her words in her sadness we do not want to go back into the dark days again of fear and terror
we were so proud of ronan and all that he stood for
don t let his death be in vain
those who murdered him have still not admitted to it
those who know the persons or others who committed this murder have a duty to come and to give evidence to the police service of northern ireland
europe has supported the peace process and it is our duty to continue to do that
