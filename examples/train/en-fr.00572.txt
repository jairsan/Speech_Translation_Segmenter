madam president with the backdrop of the global economic and financial crisis and the multi-billion stimulus packages there is a huge opportunity to increase energy efficiency to increase energy security from reliable renewable sources and to drive green technology in a green new deal
in other words to turn this crisis into an opportunity and to the benefit of us all in the long term
i welcome the two alternatives for innovative funding for combating global climate change in the recent commission communication
as the original author of the resolution on today's paper i urge member states to act on these proposals and also at next week's summit of heads of state and government to honour the declaration of the summit of twelve december last which should be put officially on the record preferably along with the final text of the eu-ets report as otherwise it will not appear in the official journal
for this and i urge the president-in-office the commissioner and madam president to remember this we need a tripartite declaration from all three institutions
this december declaration states the european council recalls that member states will determine in accordance with their respective constitutional and budgetary requirements the use of revenues generated from the auctioning of allowances in the eu emissions trading system
it takes note of their willingness to use at least half of this amount for actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions mitigate and adapt to climate change for measures to avoid deforestation to develop renewable energies energy efficiency as well as other technologies contributing to the transition to a safe and sustainable low-carbon economy including through capacity-building technology transfers research and development
it continues
in the context of an international agreement on climate change in copenhagen in two thousand and nine and for those who wish so part of this amount will be used to enable and finance actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change in developing countries that will have ratified this agreement in particular in least-developed countries
further steps are to be taken at the spring two thousand and nine european council in this regard
i await eagerly an honourable outcome of the declaration from next week's meeting of heads of state and government
