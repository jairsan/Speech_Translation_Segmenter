mr president while we are getting closer to china in terms of trade and environmental cooperation and china was host to the wonderful olympic games last year it is clearly backsliding in terms of ensuring human rights to its citizens
the response of the chinese authorities to peaceful protests in tibet last year and xinjiang this year was completely out of proportion to say the least
people everywhere in the world should have the right to protest against government policies they do not like
instead of this we had a violent and brutal reaction from the chinese authorities against the protesters and hundreds of people killed
now we have a further nine people mostly uighurs executed without mercy as a demonstration that any dissenting voices will be met by brutal and lethal force by the chinese state apparatus
while we admire the chinese culture and make progress in exchanging goods and investments it is our duty to speak loudly and clearly and condemn the killings and executions
therefore we once again reiterate our call to the chinese officials to impose a moratorium on the death penalty and grant more freedom to its provinces striving for greater autonomy while respecting the one china policy
