madam president the word on everybody's lips whatever the subject being discussed is roma
i blame that mr sarkozy for pretending to expel them
i took it for granted that they would feature in the debate on the financial transactions tax
every time a roma horse dealer tried to charge an extra couple of euro a leg out would jump a bowler-hatted tax-gatherer and sinner and demand one of the poor animal's limbs as tribute to president barroso
when the time for the debate on the eu strategy on the atlantic arrived i fully expected it to be proposed that a stretch of that ocean should be reserved for the water-borne branch of that noble tribe
they might sell fish hooks to passing boats and promise to cover hulls with a quantity of tarmacadam that they just had left over
i think we should find a particular member of the roma preferably with disabilities and conflicting sexualities
we could then make this person president of the commission
he would start by selling this place off and nobody would dare to complain
