madam president i wanted to speak about the role that sport can play in increasing economic prosperity in our regions
in wales i see rugby and other major sporting events boosting the economy of cardiff
another boost will come following the wonderful achievement of swansea city football club and i say this for the benefit of my colleague richard howitt who have just deservedly reached the premier football league after a fantastic season
i pay tribute to the manager players directors staff and fans who have made promotion possible
they will be a credit to the premier league to wales and will give a much needed boost to the local economy as fans tourists and hopefully businesses come to the region
finally i hope the eu recognises the importance of sport both economically and socially and will provide funds to boost sport at all levels particularly as since the lisbon treaty the eu now has competence in the field of sport for the first time
