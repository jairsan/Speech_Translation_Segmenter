the commission maintains regular direct contact with civil society in all countries of the world including cuba
the commission's role in cuba is appreciated and supported by civil society and by opposition groups
the commission delegation in cuba regularly receives representatives of civil society and opposition groups and the commission's departments in brussels pursue an open-door policy vis-Ã -vis any person or organisation that wants a constructive discussion on cuba or any other country
the meeting that relaunched political dialogue between the european union and cuba following the council conclusions of twenty-three june which terminated the diplomatic measures adopted in two thousand and three was an eu ministerial troika meeting on cuba in paris on sixteen october two thousand and eight
the positive spirit that reigned at that meeting allowed frank and open discussions to take place on subjects of common interest such as the international financial crisis human rights cooperation with cuba and reform of the united nations
the commission is firmly convinced and the commissioner for development and humanitarian aid has said this on several occasions that frank and open dialogue between the eu and cuba provides the best framework for discussion on matters of common concern to the two sides including questions of human rights
