mr president i welcome many of the aims of the eu twenty twenty strategy the focus on growth led by innovative businesses on sustainable growth and on achieving high employment
however to achieve this the eu must not just talk the talk we need to walk the walk
for example when undertaking the essential reforms of financial services we must remember that innovative businesses and those employers need access to capital in global markets
our member states also need to access those global capital markets and whilst all eyes are focused on the european stabilisation fund and whether it has achieved any current reduction in the immediate volatility fundamentally long-term confidence will only be achieved if as well as this ambitious growth our deficits are brought under control and public finances themselves are seen to be sustainable
