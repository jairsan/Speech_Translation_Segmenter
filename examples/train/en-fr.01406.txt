mr president greece is on the verge of fiscal collapse
spain and portugal are also struggling with increasing difficulties
if the european commission the european central bank and the european council do not act then the threat is now the disintegration of the eurozone

joaqu√≠n almunia who was a safe pair of hands in managing monetary and economic affairs is now transferred to competition which is not his cup of tea
olli rehn who was a very distinguished commissioner for enlargement is now dealing with economic and monetary affairs which is not his expertise
why is it in the interest of europe to weaken the intellectual firepower of the commission precisely in times of crisis
