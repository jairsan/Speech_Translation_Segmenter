mr president the commission is grateful to parliament for its support for our action to bridge health inequalities and for its recommendations on this important issue
i would like also to thank in particular the rapporteur ms estrela for her commitment to this cause
disparities in health between countries between regions between rich and poor between different ethnic minorities affect each and every eu member state and in many places they are getting wider
i would like to be sincere on this issue
we are now beginning to see the full effects of the economic crisis on people's health and on the health services
we are now beginning to see the effects of unemployment and of deficits so there is a risk that such inequalities will grow worse
reducing health inequalities is important both for our citizens wellbeing and for europe's economic recovery
it is a major challenge which as parliament's report points out requires action across policy areas and levels of government
your report gives important pointers for the future
you underline the need to improve access to promotion preventive care and effective healthcare services
you further emphasise the need to pay particular attention to vulnerable groups and to use new technologies such as telemedicine in a way that reduces disparities in healthcare
the commission fully shares your concern
you also highlight gender inequality as an important element contributing to social health inequalities
i personally agree fully with you on this
the commission is vigorously taking forward its programme of action to help reduce health inequalities as set out in the communication on solidarity in health by working across policies and in partnership with member states and stakeholders
to make such partnerships operational member states are now beginning a joint action on health inequalities funded through the eu health programme
this action includes work on health inequality impact assessment regional and scientific networks and stakeholder initiatives
action across policies starts with our work on public health for example on tobacco control and nutrition and through action on active and healthy ageing
but our strategy also includes commitments in areas such as employment and social policy agriculture research and regional policy
clearly more action is needed
equally clearly this will not happen overnight
it will take years to fully succeed but together we can and indeed we must make a lasting and tangible difference so that all europeans have a chance of living in good health
