congratulations to cambridge
i think cambridge is one of the greatest universities in europe and in the world
it is precisely because we do not have so many cambridges in europe that we have been working to have a real european research area because cambridge and other very important universities in europe are quite international
they are able to attract very important funding but in other countries especially small countries and some of the poorest countries they do not have those kinds of resources
that is why we not only need private funding like the ones you mentioned and i certainly welcome all the work of foundations such as the ones you mentioned but we also need public funding from the states and from the european union budget
that will be one of the points i intend to put into the next european union budget
regarding the link with alternative investment managers i really do not see this link
i think we should not use one thing or the other
we believe it is important to have sensible regulations for products on the financial markets considering what happened including in your country
it was in your country that we had the highest ever case of state aid in the history of the european union precisely because of problems in the financial markets
