as i said we have asked the commission to come up with alternative proposals on how this particular social fund can be used in this situation where as you say lots of people all around europe are without work and we hope that the commission will present such a proposal without undue delay
however we do a lot of other things as well to combat unemployment this is the responsibility of course of the member states but there is also a collective responsibility for us to try to coordinate to facilitate the completion of the internal market to eliminate obstacles to get the services directive working from one january to get rid of red tape and to stimulate people to be employable while giving them resources to complete their education or to restart in another direction
unemployment will also be discussed at a particular informal ecofin meeting in october where unemployment is one of the main issues on the agenda and in the light of the discussion that i know is taking place within the european parliament but also in almost all council formations concerning the future of the lisbon strategy there are lots of issues being discussed
so the social fund is only one instrument to combat unemployment
it can be improved and it can be more widely used to show the public how it is used in a better way probably
but it is just but one element in the whole range of instruments that we have and that we must use in order to combat unemployment
