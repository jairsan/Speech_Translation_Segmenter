madam president like others in this house i welcome the new drive to revive the nuclear non-proliferation treaty including the security council resolution to close loopholes in the existing legal framework
however i reject the direct implication within this report that the european union should replace the key member states as the major actor in this particular process
i think it beggars belief for this place to try and believe that it should extend its tentacles into this area especially considering the fact that only two member states are nuclear weapon states with an additional four participating in nato nuclear weapon sharing
this report is more interested in grabbing the chance of replacing member states around the top table of international governance than paying sufficient attention to the danger of proliferation by terrorists and rogue states
