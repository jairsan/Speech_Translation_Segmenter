mr president and fellow collaborators we need to move on from copenhagen
the truth is we do not know the way
we are stumbling around in the dark
i think we just simply have to explore every opportunity and hope that one or more of them will take us forward
but i am sure we have to try to maintain our ambitions and keep our leadership and on this point there is a crucial decision coming up within the next fortnight and i want to know what the presidency is going to do to get it right
forty per cent of our emissions come from the fossil fuels burnt in our power stations
that is why the development of carbon capture and storage technology is recognised as so important
that is why the council three years ago agreed that we should try and build up to twelve demonstration projects by twenty fifteen
now we agreed a year ago a method of financing those projects to use three hundred million in allowances from the emissions trading scheme
it took three months for that idea to come from parliament to get approval by the council to unlock the door but twelve months later we still have not agreed how to choose the projects or use the money
the commission has finally put forward a draft decision
it proposes only eight ccs projects and the timetable it recommends means that it will be impossible for them all to be built by twenty fifteen
commissioner rehn has got the hot seat then i hope someone will pass him a note between now and the end of the debate so he can explain the lack of ambition in this document
but it must be agreed however inadequate we have got to move forward
it will be debated at a meeting of the council's climate change committee on two february and there is opposition from some member states who oppose the commission having the final say over the selection of projects and the use and distribution of the money
now this meeting will be the first opportunity since copenhagen for the european union to demonstrate whether it is going forward and taking practical steps or going to slip backwards
it is a crucial test both for the commission and the presidency
so my question to the minister is is the presidency going to ensure that we get agreement at that meeting or are you going to drop the ball
