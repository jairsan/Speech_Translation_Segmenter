madam president what a relief that they have stopped burning heretics or i would be well and truly alight by now
i am though glowing hot in my opposition to the concept of man-made climate change
carbon dioxide accounts for only zero point zero three eight of our atmosphere and only four of that is influenced by man's activity
it is a vital and irreplaceable food for plant life
the more plants receive the faster they grow
a shortage of this gas will be far more serious than a surplus
the alarmist and incorrect statements that suggest any increase in carbon dioxide will create significant rises in sea levels is being used as an excuse by local authorities not to maintain low-cost wooden sea defences
when these inevitably rot after forty years <unk> nothing is done to repair them and homes are lost
this is creating an aura of despair among coastal communities
if computer predictions cannot forecast the weather properly in the short term they have no place whatsoever in predicting long-term changes
