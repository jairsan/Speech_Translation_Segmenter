this is also a global process not only a european process
canc√∫n was a significant step in the climate negotiations
at least it was able to keep alive the multilateral process and this was good but in fact it was not enough from our point of view
for us to go forward and commit to binding targets i think we should ask others namely the biggest polluters the developing and emerging economies to make a comparable effort
so far they have not committed to it
so that is why we have to find the right way to make them move
at the same time those countries that are ready to go forward and make more commitments can and should do so and the concrete way that i am going to propose to the european council on one february is to achieve more in terms of energy efficiency an area in which we are falling short of where we should be
on renewables i think we are on target to reach our goal for twenty twenty but not on energy efficiency so that is a concrete area where we can make more progress
