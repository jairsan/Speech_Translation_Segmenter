madam president i think we all welcome india's growth over the last decade or so and especially since dumping some of the failed marxist and socialist policies of yesteryear
this has enabled it to throw off the shackles and to grow in an admirable way
i would also like to remind our colleagues from all across the political spectrum that this is a trade agreement and as such we should be focusing on the trade aspects
that is not to say that the other aspects are unimportant but if we can focus on trade so as to help bring about and create wealth in india and help entrepreneurs in india to create wealth and jobs in their own villages and towns that will be to the benefit of all
it concerns me when we place too much emphasis on our standards from day one in an almost imperialist way as my colleague bill newton dunn said earlier
i think it is important that we focus on improving trade agreements to create wealth in these countries including india and help them out of poverty
that is the best way we can help
