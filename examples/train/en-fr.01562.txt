mr president we have heard a great deal about proportionality in this debate and i wonder what opponents of israel would consider to be proportionate
i wonder whether they would have preferred it if the jewish state had simply taken an equivalent amount of ordnance and rained it randomly on gaza
would that have been a proportionate response
i would like also to examine the proportionality or lack of proportionality in this report
one has the eerie feeling reading the goldstone report that one is reading about a violent assault in which the author has neglected to mention that the events took place during a boxing match
they have been stripped of all context
i am not saying that israel should be beyond criticism nor am i saying that cast lead is beyond criticism
mistakes were made
israel wants to get to a position where there is a stable palestinian entity to be a good neighbour but this policy of degrading infrastructure has retarded that goal
equally the partiality and tone of this report have pushed further away the idea of a two-state solution in which an israeli entity and a palestinian one live side by side as peaceable neighbours
