mr president can the president of the commission foresee any circumstances in which all member states including the united kingdom are forced to adopt the euro against the wishes of their peoples possibly expressed in a referendum and even against the professed wishes of their governments
the preamble to the lisbon treaty commits member states to establishing economic and monetary union a single stable currency
the word single implies that it will not coexist with other currencies
there is of course the protocol to the treaty that states that unless the united kingdom notifies the council that it intends to adopt the euro it shall be under no obligation to do so
but the question is whether the protocol will protect the united kingdom against the provisions of the treaty
other countries outside the eurozone appear to be in a less-favoured position
article one hundred and forty of the treaty states that member states with a derogation will be examined every two years on the progress being made in achieving economic and monetary union
