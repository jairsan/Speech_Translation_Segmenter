mr president i wish to speak on energy policy
as a previous speaker said securing future energy supply is a vital issue for all of us and to solve this problem we must look to a wide range of technologies not just one not just gas
obviously renewable energy will have its part to play whether it is wind biomass or tidal power but also nuclear and ccs must play their part as well
i therefore welcome recent initiatives from the uk government
it has recently brought forward a number of projects looking at new technologies for renewables but also nuclear and ccs as well
i believe that these policies will secure the energy supply in the uk for the future and i would see this as a model for the rest of europe
i certainly do not believe that we can put all our eggs in one basket we must have a wide range of technologies
i would urge colleagues here to do that in the future
