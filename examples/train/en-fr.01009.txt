mr president europe's future depends on securing energy
as both the nabucco agreement and the desertec initiative show turkey is an essential gateway and in this regard i echo mr van orden's point
it is critical at this time to be building greater trust and deeper ties with countries who will be our energy partners including middle eastern and north african states
in relation to many of these there is a connected development issue
with desertec the mass generation of electricity from solar power is a unique opportunity for revenue generation which must be used for the benefit of their people also
this opportunity must not be squandered
unfortunately some member states including my own have not used the recent past to prepare a coherent energy strategy
my own constituency the north west of england has been identified as a prime area for wind power generation and yet the uk's planning laws are an obstruction
whilst we must look outward for future energy supplies member states must also make the best use of the resources and potential they already have
