mr president while i have the opportunity can i also pay tribute to the fair and impartial manner in which you have always chaired our parliamentary sessions
it is a shame that president p√∂ttering does not somehow follow your example in so many ways in this
this report is about the united states and us-eu relations
of course america remains fundamental to europe's security and prosperity
sadly in this house there are many examples of anti-american sentiment
all of us in the eu should be profoundly grateful for the role that the us plays in the world and particularly the role that it has played in our recent history
i laugh sometimes when i hear the suggestion that it is the eu that is responsible for sixty years of peace in europe
everybody seems to forget about the contribution of the us and of course nato in contributing towards peace in europe
america should not be a rival of the eu
it should be a partner and a friend and we should build closer transatlantic relations
