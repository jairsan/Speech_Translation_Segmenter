mr president allow me to present the chamber with a few facts
only this year in january stanislav markelov the human rights lawyer who represented the assassinated journalist anna politkovskaya was gunned down in the middle of the afternoon in downtown moscow
on the same occasion anastasia baburova a journalist who tried to protect him was also shot and died
in july natalia estemirova a well-known russian human rights activist and journalist was found dead in ingushetia after being abducted by armed men in neighbouring chechnya
less than a month later another non-governmental activist zarema sadulayeva and her husband were abducted and killed
in august journalist malik akhmedilov was shot dead shortly after leaving his home in dagestan
six outstanding journalists and human rights activists dead in less than eight months
these abductions and murders are only the peak of what results from the deterioration of the human rights situation in russia where independent voices including lawyers journalists and other activists face increasing violence threats and unjustified prosecution
human rights violations in russia and especially in north caucasus can no longer be ignored
we cannot be so naive as to believe that super-powerful russia with one of the strongest intelligence services in the world is not capable of finding the perpetrators and bringing them to justice
we all regardless of our political colour have to understand that impunity for attacks against human rights defenders will contribute to more violence and a growing culture of lawlessness
the russian authorities must ensure the physical safety and freedom of movement and expression of human rights defenders in accordance with the united nations declaration on human rights defenders
