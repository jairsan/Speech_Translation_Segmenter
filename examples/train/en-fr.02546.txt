madam president i sometimes wonder if europe's response in the face of every challenge is to freeze in fear of china and call for trade sanctions and state intervention
a successful eu raw materials strategy must be aimed at encouraging free trade
it should contain sustainable and resource-efficient management innovation and access to raw materials for european companies
it should not involve stockpiling raw materials with taxpayers money
europe is increasingly dependent on a small number of key resources and is falling behind in the race to secure alternative sources but it is private companies not politicians who can determine the need to build up stockpiles
if it is an efficient use of resources they will do so
what we need instead is a comprehensive raw materials strategy that involves all aspects of access to rare earths
this includes trade research and innovation recycling and development of transport and infrastructure to enable development of domestic sources
we need better management of raw materials supply within europe and effective measures to encourage recycling and reducing waste
europe is rich in natural resources and is also strategically placed with its proximity to the resource-rich barents region
with minerals metals and forests northern europe has the potential to respond significantly to eu raw material needs in a sustainable way
we also need to encourage innovation and research into alternative solutions and find ways around materials that european companies find too expensive
the eu strategy must be based on free trade and must ensure that both developed and developing countries can benefit from the sustainable supply of raw materials
we should also use the aid-for-trade mechanism
europe needs actions aimed at innovation and eliminating trade barriers in third countries not a policy of stockpiling rare and critical raw materials and undermining democracy abroad
we need suggestions from the commission regarding raw materials and rare earth elements
we are still looking for these suggestions
