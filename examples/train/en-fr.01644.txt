i very much welcome this question by mr crowley and i am interested indeed that in ireland there is a new wireless broadband roll-out to provide first-generation access to rural communities which i think is an exciting initiative
i wanted to ask you specifically about an issue that has come up in work i have done which is on the state aid criteria for supporting local broadband initiatives
some local authorities that i know have been trying to work with public authorities to consolidate demand together to give a viable package for an investor
but apparently in some cases this is considered to infringe state aid criteria
so could i ask if her services could support some of these community projects by giving some clear guidelines about state aid criteria to help those public private partnerships which would i agree be crucial to achieving universal broadband
