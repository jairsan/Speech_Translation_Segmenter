mr president citizenship defines who we are
it is the bedrock of our identity
i am a british citizen and i am proud of that not least because of the vicious campaign of the ira to try and coerce me and my constituents out of that citizenship something which thankfully they have failed to do
citizenship lies in member states
it should not be diverted and it should not be shared
thus i reject this contrivance of european citizenship which of course is a complement to the ongoing efforts to be advanced by the lisbon treaty to build the statehood of the eu and thus this notion that we all have to be whether we like it or not want it or not eu citizens first and foremost
i reject that philosophy as i reject the lisbon treaty
