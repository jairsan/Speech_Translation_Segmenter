mr president the legislative process as it is carried out by this parliament seems to be designed to prevent individual members from making individual judgements
legislative proposals and amendments are re-written or re-assigned to different batches of amendments or re-divided at the last possible moment
those members of large party groups who wish to obey unthinkingly do not need to concern themselves with this because they blindly follow the instructions of their party or group leaderships
however independent-minded meps either of large or small groups who wish to take an independent judgement before they vote must sometimes decide between attending a debate during the morning preceding a vote and leaving crucial judgements to their assistants or absenting themselves from those debates so they can make a personal decision
this is no way to run a democratic institution
