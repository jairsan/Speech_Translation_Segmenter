madam president i was very glad to see that the vote went ahead in the toy safety directive for the simple reason that if we are going to send a strong message around the world about toys and toy safety it has to be done at christmas
to have put it off would have diluted the message
at this time of year people are thinking about toys
again this year millions of chinese toys have been taken off the market as they were last year
the issues which have been lead arsenic mercury and pcbs are very serious and it does not matter what a toy is for whether it is a book or something to ride on or whatever i know as a mother that at some point it could end up in a child's mouth
so we cannot be careful enough with toys but i am glad that we have sent this message now
