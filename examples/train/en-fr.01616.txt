mr president we have had two speakers addressing this house to reject the resolution but no speaker to speak in favour of the approval of this resolution
so i think it is only fair that someone who can speak and urge members to speak in favour of the resolution should be able to do so
if you allow me just one minute may i say that the reason why the libe committee rejected these rules and therefore put forward this resolution is very simple
we have been told by our legal services not once but twice that the commission exceeded its powers in bringing forward these rules
this is why we rejected them
we definitely want these rules i myself come from a country that wants these rules but we do not want the european commission to exceed its powers
that is why we should support this resolution
