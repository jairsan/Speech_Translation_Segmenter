mr president i congratulate my colleague linda mcavan on her report
with almost two hundred zero deaths per year in the eu caused by adverse reactions to prescribed drugs i welcome the new eu-wide system to monitor the safety of medicines which have already been approved for use by doctors
adverse reactions are the fifth most common cause of hospital death in europe
this legislation will set out rules and procedures for monitoring the safety profile of medicinal products once they have been authorised and placed on the market
the new powers will also equip national and eu authorities to target the growing problem of forged or falsified medicines which pose an enormous threat to public health
the more up-to-date information available to the healthcare sector and to individual patients on the safety of medicines in common use the better it is for the health and safety of all european citizens
i therefore welcome the european medicines web portal which will be created and linked to national medicines web portals in each member state and where patients will be able to find information about the safety of the medicine they are taking
