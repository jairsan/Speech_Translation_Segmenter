mr president i am particularly supportive of this report the mention of credit unions and recognition of their contribution to providing microcredit facilities
as not-for-profit organisations credit unions play a unique role in providing microcredit to many who would not be offered credit by many of the other financial institutions
i know that credit unions are not strong in all european countries but they are strong in many with reserves in excess of eur forty billion
worldwide credit unions have reserves in excess of usd one point one trillion with almost one hundred and eighty million members worldwide
at a time when many people are losing faith in banking institutions not-for-profit financial institutions are a viable alternative and they need our support
in particular they need to be included in the jasmine programme so that as providers of microfinance they have access to business support services such as mentoring training advice financing and education etc
finally a clarification on the muscardini report i believe we voted for and passed amendment one where the term sexual and reproductive rights was amended to sexual and reproductive health
in this context i am not sure i agree with my irish colleagues who spoke earlier on this matter
