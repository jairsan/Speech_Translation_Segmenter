madam president as we review the rome statute of the international criminal court let us be reminded that its creation truly marks a success for liberal democracy and a commitment to effective international law
with all eu member states ratifying to comply with the rome statute we set out on the next chapter of meeting our ambitions and responsibilities in the field of human rights peace and justice
a critical evaluation is important but the icc is already an important institution in ensuring that these fundamental values are not just european but universal
it is a last resort as commissioner reding said but an important one
the eu and member states should continue their commitment to the icc or the principles it seeks to ensure by adopting the eu guidelines on the icc
it is a primary obligation to investigate and prosecute those who commit war crimes genocide and crimes against humanity
with the lisbon treaty we are working towards an effective common foreign eu policy
the high representative should actively promote the accession to the rome statute of other global players china india russia and important candidate member states such as turkey but also the long-term ally of the eu the united states should be engaged in a dialogue of contributing to global justice and should seriously consider joining its ally
as a dutch european i would like to reassure our citizens that the hague invasion act will never be invoked
the eu needs to work constructively with turkey and the us to stop impunity in iran which is one of the most urgent cases of aggressors and where execution rape and torture are brought upon citizens by their own government on a daily and systematic basis
we need to work on the true globalisation or universalisation of human rights justice and the rule of law and the icc is an important instrument to meet this goal
support for this court needs to be globalised as well
the european parliament has been working constructively and is united on this subject
