madam president in my constituency of northern ireland we currently have sixteen zero people suffering from dementia
they their families and their carers will welcome a proactive approach to tackling this disease which can be so devastating to both sufferers and families
it is in areas like this that i believe it is good to see cooperation across european states
i believe that a coordinated approach to tackling disease can bring forward new evidence new medical breakthroughs and in time hopefully improve treatment and cure
in the united kingdom we currently have just over four hundred zero people suffering from alzheimer's
this united kingdom figure is likely to be something in the region of seven hundred and fifty zero people by twenty twenty-five
it is therefore imperative that something is done to improve our diagnosis treatment and prevention and social research into the welfare of patients and their families particularly families who act as carers
a coordinated approach and a sharing of research are vital as long as that research respects the sanctity of human life in all its forms
