madam president i have listened carefully to the numerous contributions
the commission hopes that we will find a solution for these important financing instruments
however we need to be able to fully implement external relations financial instruments
proper implementation of our external actions should not be taken hostage by a dispute between the institutions
it is difficult to retain credibility vis-Ã -vis the outside world on such a basis and this exposes us to loss of relevance as a global player and trade negotiator
the commission stands ready to work towards a rapid solution that is agreed by all the institutions concerned
in the current instruments which are in force until twenty thirteen which means another two years multiannual strategy papers are considered to be implementing measures necessary for the implementation of the budget
such measures are subject to the comitology system
strategy papers are technical documents and so by their nature are not suited to take the form of binding legal acts
the current instruments have only two more years to run and there remain only a few strategy papers to be put in place
the commission considers that to change this system now would require significant changes to instruments which would take too long to put in place and which would cause major disruption to eu external cooperation
the commission already involves parliament in the process of democratic scrutiny of strategy papers
the commission is willing to reinforce this process with substantive scrutiny rights for parliament
it is too soon to say what the new instruments will look like because they are subject to extensive consultation with stakeholders and to commission proposals
provided that the criteria established in article two hundred and ninety of the lisbon treaty are fully respected the option is open to consider recourse to delegated acts in the new instruments but the commission does not yet have a set view on this question
