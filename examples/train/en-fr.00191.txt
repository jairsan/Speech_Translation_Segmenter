i know very well that the financial crisis and its impact on the real economies are of huge concern to many europeans and as such this will also have a particular impact on the european elections
it is no wonder then that most people would like the election campaign to focus on economic issues affecting their everyday lives such as unemployment economic growth inflation and purchasing power
more recent opinion polls also show that people now see the eu as a shelter from the current crisis and want the eu to regulate at global level
the commission keeps pace with developments
on twenty-nine october we adopted a framework focusing on dealing both with a crisis in the markets preventing future crises through reforms of economic governance and minimising the impact on jobs and growth
proposals to follow this up are in preparation and are central strategic priorities for our legislative and work programme for two thousand and nine which we presented to parliament yesterday and which was debated
it is important that the need for action has been recognised by the commission parliament and council and that we are about to propose sustaining jobs growth and solidarity as one of the interinstitutional communication priorities for next year
this means that it will be one of the themes on which eu institutions and member states will work in partnership to communicate on eu activities in this area
plans will be drawn up on how best to do this
i have already mentioned the ep elections which are another of the interinstitutional priorities
here preparations are more advanced as we have all known for some time that it would be a priority
our institutions are working in close cooperation on all election-related communications activities and the commission will contribute actively to the framework communication strategy adopted by parliament
the commission's goal is to raise people's awareness of the elections and generate debate on substantive eu policy issues
this will be partly achieved by the use of our central tools including the use of audiovisual media and the internet and complemented by many decentralised activities organised by the representations in each member state in close cooperation with parliament's information offices
those events should make people aware of the fact that the voter has a choice between different policy visions of europe and that these choices will make a big difference to the lives of all our citizens
