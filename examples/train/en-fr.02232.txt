mr president i too welcome the rapporteur's proposals and certainly we are living in a much smaller world than ever before
interaction between people is far greater and that is set to continue rapidly into the future so obviously the more harmonisation we have in measurement instruments the better
i certainly welcome the repeal of the metrology directives and cutting red tape by twenty-five
sometimes i think we underestimate the ability of people to adapt
i saw in my country how easily we adapted from the old pounds shillings and pence to the euro and cents and also only in recent years from miles to kilometres in terms of travel and speed limits
this has made life easier for many people and will continue to do so
i think this is a step in the right direction so congratulations again
