madam president last week i met a man in my local church who was arranging his son's memorial service
his thirty-seven year old son had died the previous year of cancer
no parent should have to go through the pain of losing a child
as a mother i can think of nothing worse
but we have over two zero parents brothers mothers and sisters in cyprus who are suffering every day as they wonder about the fate of their loved one
in nineteen sixty-three sixty-four civil unrest and the subsequent turkish invasion and occupation of cyprus in nineteen seventy-four resulted in approximately two zero turkish as well as greek cypriots going missing
their fate is unknown and in nineteen eighty-one the committee on missing persons was set up and funded primarily by the eu
the work they have done in this area has brought peace to many families
there is much more work for them to do with over one and a half thousand people still missing
i urge this house to support the work of the cmp and to support written declaration ten which is humanitarian in its objectives and seeks to bring peace and remembrance and reconciliation to these families
