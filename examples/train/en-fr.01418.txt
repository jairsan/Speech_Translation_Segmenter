mr president today this parliament has voted on a document relating to tax fraud and evasion that document did not have the support of my group
whilst i fully support many measures which have been suggested to stop tax fraud and evasion this document went far further and there were three major concerns
firstly taking action against those who commit fraud should not be used as a backdoor way by those who want to increase tax harmonisation across europe for those of us who honestly pay our taxes
this parliament has for a long time defended the right of member states to have their own say over corporate tax rates and we should continue to do so
secondly it suggests an eu-level levy on taxation areas
we have resisted plans for this parliament to have europe-wide taxes
the third point is on sharing information
yes we should share some information but we should always think how much for what purpose and for what benefit and we should not consider that all circumstances are identical
