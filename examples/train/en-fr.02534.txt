madam president i very much welcome the járóka report because it gives us an opportunity to mention some specific points
the roma inclusion strategy must be guided by an insider approach that is designed by roma for roma which means empowerment of roma inclusion in the decision-making process hiring of roma staff and mediators in key positions at local national and eu level
unlawful practices which continue with impunity in eu member states have to stop violence against roma violations of their right to free movement increasing activities of extremist political parties and politicians systematic segregation of romany children in education widespread residential segregation of roma trafficking in human beings denial of access to healthcare and social services coercive sterilisation of romany women
many reasons thus justify this report and many more reasons justify this strategy so i welcome very much the report the strategy and as you say commissioner let us keep up the work
