madam president it is a necessary evil of our times that unfortunately human and animal health research requires as a must animal experimentation
it is my firm belief that no true scientist enjoys experimenting on animals or does so when alternative means of research are available
such research must of course at all times be as humane as possible to the animals involved
to this end the directive under debate seeks correctly in my view to improve matters significantly and decidedly
important areas of note are the safeguarding of the principles of ethical review and authorisation as well as the concepts of enhanced national inspections and increased transparency throughout
it must be emphasised that the aim of the scientific and political world should always be to phase out the use of animals in research if and when alternative and effective methods not using animals are made available
