how ironic that the european parliament is voting today on an agreement to kick poor and penniless pakistani citizens out of the european union and back to a homeland that is ravaged by disastrous flooding
the long-suffering poor and peasants and workers of pakistan are suffering even more than ever with twenty of their country devastated by the floods with crops destroyed cattle killed children going hungry and up to twenty million people affected
it would be much more appropriate for us to discuss how we can attack relieve and end poverty in pakistan for example by forcing the international monetary fund to cancel the crushing burden of debt on pakistan to remove the burden of personal debt on the workers and poor of pakistan by the cancellation of those debts and to increase the aid to relieve the suffering with such aid not being channelled through a corrupt government but under the democratic control of peasants workers and the poor who are the real victims of this situation
that would be a far more appropriate response to the suffering of the people of pakistan
