mr president i have three brief points to make
firstly complacency over energy policy is putting us increasingly in the dangerous position of dependency on russia
where possible it clearly makes sense to coordinate our response but any unified eu policy would inevitably be skewed by those countries that are already in bed with gazprom and related interests
and we should not be handing yet another area of vital national interest to the european commission which sees every possible crisis as an opportunity to extend its competence
needless to say many of us will vote against any endorsement of the lisbon treaty or further efforts to take forward political integration on the back of the various energy concerns of our countries
secondly diversification of sources of supply requires greater commitment to nabucco
for the success of this pipeline turkish cooperation is essential yet the opening of the energy chapter in eu negotiations with turkey is being blocked
what are the council and commission doing to resolve this unhelpful situation
thirdly i notice the word nuclear does not appear in the resolution
clearly sustainable diverse sources of energy supply require a greater commitment to nuclear energy and in that respect i agree with our colleague mr van baalen
