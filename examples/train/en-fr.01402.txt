mr president i hope it is worth waiting for
i want to concentrate on the resolution on the framework agreement having been part of parliament's negotiating team
president barroso we had i think you will admit some very interesting debates on the meaning of words especially in my language but one of the phrases you used at the beginning of our meetings was that you spoke about your absolute commitment to the parliamentary dimension of the european union and i think you were absolutely genuine and positive in your use of that phrase yet we never discussed that one
post-lisbon and post the resolution on the new framework agreement this parliament is much more than a mere dimension it is a reality a real force a true parliament worthy of the name
you might i suppose call the original parliamentary assembly a dimension but not this parliament
this parliament is now a full legislative partner as per the resolution to be treated on an equal inclusive and informed basis with council and not to be by-passed by resorting to soft law or other instruments however worthy a parliament fully and rightly able to hold your commission as executive to account
we look forward to seeing not only yourself mr barroso but all of your fellow commissioners here for a question hour before this chamber
this parliament will insist on its right of oversight in respect of subsequent changes to your team this parliament is ready to play its proper role as the only transnational directly elected parliament in international relations
but above all this new forceful parliament containing a pro-european majority wants you please to take a lead and in that we will be your willing partner and supporter
but please we are no mere dimension we are a true real parliament
