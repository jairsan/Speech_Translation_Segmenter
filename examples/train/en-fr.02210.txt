president barroso you have made various statements including the statement this afternoon about how the eu and its member states respect fundamental rights and the rule of law but the inquiry on extraordinary rendition of which mr coelho was the chair and i was the vice-chair reported prima facie evidence that around a dozen eu and other european countries had colluded in war on terror abuses such as disappearance and torture
frankly i am afraid you gave a rather waffly answer to mr coelho
we believed that the commission and the council had not respected article six of the treaty and we urged them to ascertain the truth about what had happened and to take action if appropriate under article seven which means sanctions of human rights abuses
frankly there has been no result
this leaves the eu open to the charge of hypocrisy
what will you do now to get full political and legal accountability for european collusion in human rights abuses in the name of the so-called war on terror
