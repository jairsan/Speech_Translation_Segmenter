mr president i welcome the agreement reached last week on the climate change package and congratulate our rapporteurs and the french presidency for their efficiency
it was important to keep our ambitious targets but in the current economic turmoil we could not afford to impose an impossible burden on our industry and impede european competitiveness
this is why in particular for the effort-sharing decision i warmly welcome the flexibility granted to member states to reach their targets while introducing corrective action instead of sanctions
this has always been my position in the committee on industry but i want to repeat it
flexibility is needed and this is even more crucial when regulating new sectors and before imposing stricter provisions we need impact assessments
i am also very satisfied that codecision was ensured in the case of a higher reduction target
it is a matter of principle
our citizens did not send us here not to have a say in such important decisions
