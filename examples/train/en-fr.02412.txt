mr president the question i wanted to ask the honourable member was how can democracy flourish in societies where there are no institutions and histories of democratic tradition
democracy does not just pop up in an unfertile field
we keep talking about creating democratic states without having worked on creating the democratic institutions upon which democracy flowers
