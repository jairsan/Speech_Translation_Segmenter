mr president i want to thank the commissioner for reminding this house that there is also a demand side to energy security
the decision to take incandescent light bulbs off the european market will save the equivalent of the annual electricity generation of finland
this autumn we are seeking agreement with the council on a package of energy efficient measures
forty per cent of the energy we use is consumed in buildings so it matters a great deal for the future of energy security that we set high standards of efficiency for both new and existing buildings
i hope that member states in the council will support the parliament's proposals which are designed to put a stop to the utter waste of energy which is currently used in heating cooling and lighting
if nothing else ministers should support those proposals out of self-interest because it will considerably ease their job and their responsibility of keeping the lights on and the gas flowing
