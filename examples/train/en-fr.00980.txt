madam president these measures allow visa-free access to the eu schengen group member states from serbia montenegro and macedonia as from january twenty ten
the commission envisages giving albania and bosnia and herzegovina visa-free access possibly by mid twenty ten
so within twelve months we could see another twenty point seven million people given free access to the eu
strictly speaking this should not affect the uk which is not a member of the schengen group but in reality it will
access to the eu for millions more people from some of the poorest and most corrupt countries in europe will enable them to cross the first barrier in gaining illegal entry to britain
these countries will eventually be full members of the eu anyway with full legal access to the eu
these measures are yet another undermining of britain's ability to control her own borders and yet another reason why britain should leave the european union
