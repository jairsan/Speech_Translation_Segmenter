mr president i want to give an explanation of vote on the calendar for twenty twelve
of course what we were voting on was utter nonsense because it does not address the problem of the three different parliaments strasbourg brussels and of course luxembourg which everybody forgets about
the total combined costs i believe are something in the region of eur two hundred and fifty million per month
what i would like to do is to offer a constructive suggestion
instead of meeting on twelve different occasions in strasbourg why do we not meet on twelve different sessions in strasbourg in one week first day three sessions second day three sessions third day three sessions fourth day three sessions
that way we only need to spend one week a year here
we can spend the rest of the time in brussels if we have to and we can save an enormous amount of cost and an enormous amount of inconvenience
