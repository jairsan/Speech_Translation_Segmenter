mr president i should like to thank ms angelilli for this report
i would echo what has been said by our colleague ms bauer in terms of our own member states taking action to sign and ratify some of the conventions and protocols which are missing at the moment
if we are looking for a common framework and a common approach these are very key reference points which also help to send a signal from member states that they too are concerned about these issues
i think this is one of the key things they should be doing and it would be interesting to know why certain member states have not yet actually signed up to the relevant conventions and protocols
we welcome much of the report in terms of the rights-based approach which i would like to see leading on and away from the view that it is only about criminal justice
this is actually about the rights and the protection of children and young people
we need those clear measures to support children who have been victims whether through court proceedings where obviously the key issue is to find the truth but not in a way that leaves children more traumatised than they were at the beginning of the process or through the collective work on identifying children
however the protection also has to involve the children themselves
we should encourage internet literacy among children as well their own understanding of what the dangers are and what they should be looking for so that they too can play an active part in helping to combat these crimes
we intend to support certain of the amendments this morning particularly where we think there are certain principles which we tamper with at our peril such as on double criminality and confidentiality in certain professions and one or two others where we think the concept perhaps needs further definition
we are however generally very much in favour of this report and look forward to its further progress
