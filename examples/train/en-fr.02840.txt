mr president the commission welcomes the report as it supports our smart regulation agenda and aims to strengthen the shared responsibility of the eu institutions in this area
the commission also welcomes the fact that the report supports some of its suggestions addressed to the european parliament through the smart regulation communication but we also know about the few highly problematic proposals
the commission has already made clear in its smart regulation communication that it cannot and will not accept requests that would affect its autonomy in carrying out impact assessments for instance the externalisation of the impact assessment board or that would otherwise affect its right of initiative
let me recall that the european court of auditors in a recent special report on impact assessments in the eu institutions has confirmed that the commission's impact assessment system has been effective in supporting decision making within the eu institutions and in raising the quality of our proposals
the court of auditors also found that the commission has in place the structures needed for smart regulation and that the impact assessment board clearly helps to raise the quality of our impact assessments
the commission will take a position on the report after the adoption of the resolution
