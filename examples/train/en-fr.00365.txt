mr president what is happening in gaza is heartbreaking
that the devastation is perpetuated by a supposedly western nation is unfathomable
i agree one hundred that israelis have a right to live without the threat of rocket attacks
but what is being done in gaza is not justice it is slaughter
there is no excuse there is no possible justification
the most shameful thing for us in the eu is that it is being carried out by one of our preferred trading partners
in two thousand and seven the value of eu-israel trade was eur twenty-five point seven billion
given the amount of money we contribute to israel's economy we carry a grave responsibility when that money contributes to the death of civilians and children
if we do not act the blood of those in gaza will equally stain our hands
i call on this parliament and all eu bodies to impose trade sanctions on israel immediately and to keep them in place until a meaningful ceasefire is agreed
if we do any less than our utmost to stop this killing we become accessories to the slaughter
