madam president we have known for many months that greece is in a very difficult position
we know that the euro is depreciating at a rapid rate before our eyes and that government bond spreads are rising
no one can still doubt that europe is in a serious crisis just when we thought we were back on our feet again
we seriously need to address the issues of competitiveness of productivity and of sustainable economic growth but still the leaders of europe are bickering about what action to take
this is not the time
we need real action and we need it now
since it is apparent that peer pressure in the council does not work we need binding targets and new transparent means to scrutinise the reports about each member state
we need a fundamental respect for the stability and growth pact and we need reliable and true figures on which we can base our decisions
to put additional pressure on governments structural funds and other european support must be tied to governments ability to provide us with correct figures
let me make a comparison
when a small farmer makes mistakes on half a hectare he or she loses out on the support for everything he or she does for a number of years
that is the comparison we have to make
that is why we are so tough on governance in parliamentary resolutions
it is also most embarrassing that the commission is not putting forward proposals which we have been discussing for years
to create a platform for future growth the strategic policy agenda must be included in the eu twenty twenty strategy
let me take some examples
we negotiated the economic recovery plan
most of it is not enforced
parliament asked to have a plan b so it is included in the results but the plan b is not yet set into action
we have decided on a set plan new energy technology
we still do not have fifty of the funding for the set plan a real strategic tool
the most cost-effective means to reduce greenhouse gases is to move forward with a strategy for energy efficiency
i therefore call on the commission and the member states to put energy efficiency at the top of the agenda in action
the existing legislation must be stepped up because it is not sufficient
we need the promised energy efficiency action plan promised for so long
we need energy in infrastructure the energy equivalent of fast trains super grids and high-tech smart grids are needed and we have the money for this
we need to ensure technical innovation and we also need to encourage and put forward a strategy to combat social exclusion and gender inclusion
in the light of the current crisis the commission must step up to its responsibility and finish what we started together
the council has to be bolder and stop bickering
we will put forward a bold resolution on the second step of the twenty twenty strategy
