madam president democracy in venezuela is in danger and i would like to add another case which relates to the limitation by the government of the freedom of speech and its control of civil society
one recent situation with implications in the entire region is the attempt by venezuela in june twenty ten to amend a draft resolution on civil society participation in the organisation of american states
venezuela wanted to make civil society participation subject to domestic law
there is a bad precedent
a similar clause in the treaty on the implementation of the inter-american convention against corruption was used by venezuela to prevent ngos reporting on corruption in this country
the commission and the council must strongly and openly support civil society in venezuela and must watch with great care the upcoming parliamentary elections
the legitimacy of the next parliament is crucial in these times of deteriorating democracy
finally i would like to add my voice in calling for the release of the judge
