mr president i too am very pleased to have supported this initiative
it is a tangible expression of an example of one of the measures that have been undertaken by the eu in response to the current economic crisis
this particular initiative targets those who would not normally have access to the credit market those to whom the banks and other financial institutions would say no thank you we do not want your business
people for example who have lost their jobs who are at risk of social exclusion people who have difficulty re-entering the job market now have an opportunity to set up their own business because they can access loans with guaranteed equity of up to eur twenty-five zero
i think this initiative will make a difference to many people and i thank the spanish presidency for their efforts in concluding an agreement and also the rapporteur for her hard work
i think we have a good deal here today especially for those as i said who are excluded from the credit market and on a personal level i am also very pleased to see the credit unions are among those institutions which can pass on this funding to their members
