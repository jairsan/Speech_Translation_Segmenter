madam president thank you all for your patience in the chamber
i wanted to speak on this but i have just got too much to say today i am so excited by all the votes that have been going through the chamber today
yes the common fisheries policy yes let us talk about sustainable development but the two are inherently contradictory
if you want to look at a sustainable fisheries policy you have to look at property rights and market-based solutions
look at those countries where fishermen are given rights that are tradable and passed on from generation to generation
that is the best way to make sure that we have sustainable fish stocks not some artificial communistic method where you have central planning in fishing
that is why we are seeing great depletion of fish stocks and we will all suffer in the end
