mr president i warmly welcome the chance to put a question to president barroso because the conference of committee chairs has for the first time been moved backward by an hour so we committee chairmen are able to be here for the first time
i want to ask him about a policy to help framework conditions for research and innovation which i was rather disappointed to see did not make it into this first draft of twenty twenty but i hope will be there in future and that is to harness the huge potential of public procurement throughout the european union to stimulate innovative products and services
i want to ask him today if he would take up the recommendations endorsed almost unanimously by this parliament in my report last november which showed how this could be done
just to give him an idea and to share it with colleagues if one of european public procurement was secured for innovative products and services it would raise the investment in innovation across the european union by no less than eur fifteen billion
