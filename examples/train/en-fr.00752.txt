mr president before i go further i would just like to pay tribute to the rapporteur mrs morgan
i know she is about to leave this place and though we do not always agree on issues i think everyone will agree that she has done a tremendous amount of work on this report
we all know if we look at the history of liberalisation in the eu that telecoms liberalisation has been a great success offering choice lower prices and better services to consumers right across the eu
it is a shame that the postal market and the energy market in particular have lagged behind in this respect
this is certainly a few steps in the right direction but we still need to sort out the problem of network unbundling and also access to other markets
it is not right that some markets such as the uk market remain open to competition whereas companies in germany and france are able to access the uk market yet prevent companies from the uk and other countries accessing their own market
the time for protectionism is over
it is time to have more faith in the market
