i welcome the motion for a resolution voted on today on international adoption
i know of several people in my own constituency who have gone or who are right now going through this process and it is a delight to watch the joy in parents and children's faces alike at the conclusion
to get to this point however is too often a long road in many instances taking many years
it can as the motion states be an overly bureaucratic process and we are right as a parliament to look for ways that such bureaucracy can be reduced with a more streamlined process
paramount in all of this however are the needs and safety of the children many of whom are in great need
it is right that all safeguards are in place to protect children from being placed where they may be vulnerable
but what often appears the case is that potential loving caring parents are put through too much and simply leave the process
in this case both parent and child lose out
