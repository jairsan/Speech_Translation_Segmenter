madam president i wish to speak about urban and city funding
commissioner you have visited belfast a number of times
you will have seen i hope as i have the distinct benefit of the urban programme particularly in north belfast
hence i regret the passing of that programme particularly since nothing comparable has taken its place
the switch of focus to private-public partnerships is a poor substitute with access to jessica doing little to soften the blow at least so far
in truth we moved away from urban without a practical substitute in place
in the present economic climate the prospect of jessica producing the anticipated leverage effect is diminishing leaving an unfilled gap in many cities where urban redevelopment and investment are still needed
the gap between lip-service in government strategies and delivery on the ground is widening with every tightening of the fiscal belt
thus the absence of specific funding for urban spend in the two thousand and seven twenty fifteen programme is increasingly being felt
