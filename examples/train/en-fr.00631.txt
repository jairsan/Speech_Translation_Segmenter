mr president the prime minister has received some criticism this afternoon for his comment british jobs for british workers but you can brush that aside because from the moment he said it i do not think anybody seriously thought that he would ever as a british prime minister put the interests of british workers above that of his european dream
my goodness me you showed that this afternoon prime minister
it is just a pity that apart from ukip virtually nobody seems to have bothered to turn up to listen to you
you are very popular here
you are very popular indeed because within a few days of the irish saying no to the lisbon treaty you had rammed that treaty through the british parliament breaking a specific manifesto pledge that you would give the british people a referendum on the constitutional treaty
shame on you prime minister for doing that
you have devalued democracy in our country you have devalued the trust that voters put in you as a british prime minister
of course we know the reason why
the reason why is that we would have voted no
you said in your speech that none but those on the extremes oppose european union
well that may be right amongst professional career politicians but a clear majority of the british people want us to have friendship and free trade with the european union but do not want to be members of this political union
you cannot continue to build this european union against public opinion
if you do it against the will of the people you are storing up enormous social and political problems for the future
please let the peoples of europe decide their destiny
do not have it done in parliaments like this and parliaments like westminster
it will not work as far as the economy is concerned you have told us that somehow you are the economic guru you are the man who can save the world
well i remember very well your first big act as chancellor when you sold four hundred metric tonnes of gold on the world's exchanges at usd two hundred and seventy-five an ounce
at today's valuation that would be usd ten billion higher
it was not just the fact that you got it wrong because we can all get it wrong
it was the fact that you announced in advance how much you were going to sell and on what day you were going to sell it
it was an error so basic that the average a-level economics student even in these educationally devalued times would not have done this
to add to that you have destroyed our private pension system and you took away from the bank of england its ability to regulate the banks and gave it to the tick-box bureaucrats of the fsa in canary wharf
we have not heard an apology
your government has apologised for the amritsar massacre you have apologised for slavery you have apologised for virtually everything
will you please apologise for what you did as british chancellor and then perhaps we might just listen to you
