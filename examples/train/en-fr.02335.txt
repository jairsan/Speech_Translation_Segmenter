mr president i am deeply disturbed that our amendment to require medical regulators in one country to tell their eu counterparts when a health professional is facing disciplinary or criminal proceedings failed at the committee stage and will not be put to the final vote on this new eu cross-border health law
let me tell you about the case of german doctor daniel ubani who unlawfully killed my cambridgeshire constituent david gray by administering ten times the recommended dose for a painkiller
he was struck off in britain yet he continues to practise in germany today
then there is the case of dr marcos ariel hourmann convicted for manslaughter for deliberately administering a lethal injection in spain yet working at the accident and emergency department of west suffolk hospital also in my constituency despite a clear request to spain about his fitness to practise
these examples show that there is a huge loophole in european law which allows health professionals recognised as unfit to practise in one of our countries the opportunity to work and to put patients at risk in another
i would ask the commissioner to explain why
