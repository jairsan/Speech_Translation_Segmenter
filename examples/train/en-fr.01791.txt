madam president i condemn the use of bullets against protestors in thailand thousands of people died hundreds were injured
as reported by amnesty international eyewitness accounts and video recordings show clearly that the military is firing live rounds at unarmed people who pose no threat whatsoever to the soldiers or to others
among the dead there are medical doctors and children
thai soldiers must stop firing violence against protestors cannot lead and will not lead to a democratic solution
the government must be aware that crushing the protestors may clear the streets for now but will not solve the problem that brought the people onto the streets and before anything else comes human life so stop the firing
