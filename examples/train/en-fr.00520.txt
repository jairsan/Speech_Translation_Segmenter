mr president there was some controversy about the recasting procedure and my name was mentioned in this context
i would like firstly to point out that the rapporteur who introduced this into our rules of procedure was maryl√®ne renault not me
perhaps a word of explanation is necessary concerning the correct actions of the president of the parliament
we often have pieces of legislation amending for the fifteen sixteen or seventeen time some existing pieces of legislation
that is very confusing for people who have to deal with this legislation
we have rightly embarked on a procedure for codifying such legislation putting it in a single readable manageable text
we frequently have that before us and because it does not change the substance we have a simplified procedure for that
however when it comes to recasting we have a difficulty
there the commission is putting forward a proposal to change one element of a package of existing legislation and to simply codify the rest without changing it
we have voluntarily restricted ourselves to tabling amendments of substance only to the part that the commission is proposing to modify and not to use the codification of the remaining part as an opportunity to reopen the substance
maybe we should as has been suggested by one of our colleagues
however there would be a problem under the treaty with regard to the demarcation of the right of initiative between us and the commission
it is certainly not however an issue where colleagues were right to complain about the actions of the president
under our existing rules which we gave ourselves as a parliament and which we approved by an absolute majority of our members the correct procedure has been followed
