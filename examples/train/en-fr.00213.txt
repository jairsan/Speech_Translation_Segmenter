mr president on behalf of the commission and commissioner michel i wish to share some remarks about this issue of human rights in somalia
firstly i would like to share the concern about the continuing conflict and political instability in somalia
somalia remains a context where fundamental rights and respect for basic human dignity continue to be shunned by armed entities perpetrating systematic and widespread attacks against civilians
in the last few months an escalating wave of attacks on humanitarian workers peace activists and human rights defenders has been sweeping southern and central somalia
at least forty somali human rights defenders and humanitarian workers were killed between january and september two thousand and eight alone
as a result of these attacks a number of humanitarian organisations have been forced to withdraw staff from mogadishu humanitarian access received further blows and human rights and humanitarian conditions further deteriorated
the commission together with the member states and other international actors is committed to helping at this critical juncture
the eu supports the efforts of the office of the high commissioner for human rights including the independent expert on human rights in somalia shamsul bari to come to the creation of a mechanism to investigate systematic human rights abuses by all parties
at the development level the eu is strongly involved in supporting human rights organisations mainly in training and funding for identification documentation monitoring of human rights abuses and advocacy
in particular the commission is increasingly involving civil society in any programme of reconstruction and national reconciliation including exchange programmes for civil society with other regional organisations paralegal training public awareness campaigns and women's groups work on enhancing their political representation and participation in reconciliation processes
moreover the eu supports programmes focusing on law enforcement and reinforcing the judiciary
meanwhile we need to work to improve security and to make the somali reconciliation process move forward
a climate of insecurity will only serve to worsen the human rights situation and encourage violations of international humanitarian law
any lasting peace in somalia must be based on accountability and justice for the human rights violations committed by all sides throughout the somali conflict
