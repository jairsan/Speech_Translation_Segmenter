it is true of course that international trade has been particularly deeply affected by the crisis
the world trade organisation secretariat estimates that global trade will drop by ten in two thousand and nine with a fourteen decline in developed countries and about seven for emerging countries
this calls for ambitious reactions which is what we have been doing both on trade finance multilateral negotiations and bilateral negotiations
together with member states we have taken a number of important steps to increase the availability of trade finance
where commercial parties were no longer willing or able to provide export finance insurance member states have stepped in via the export credit agencies
with regard to short-term insurance this has been facilitated by the commission decision to temporarily relax the conditions to offer such support
we furthermore agree to temporary relaxation of the oecd rules on medium- to long-term credit insurance
at the multilateral level we strongly endorse the commitments made in the g twenty context for national export credit agencies to make available sufficient government export credit insurance capacity where this is needed and we also support the efforts by multilateral financing organisations to make available new trade financing facilities or increase the envelopes of existing ones
to make sure we consolidate and increase exports we are continuing to pursue the various trade negotiations we have engaged in
honourable members know that the priority on the multilateral front is and remains an ambitious balanced and comprehensive conclusion to the doha round which would reap great benefits for the world and of course for the european economy
the recent meeting in new delhi which i attended has provided new political momentum and together with the upcoming g twenty summit in pittsburgh it will hopefully enable us to conclude the deal in twenty ten
we are calling for real engagement with key world trade organisation partners in the months ahead in order to move the negotiations forward on the basis of the package which has been tentatively negotiated up until this point
as members know we are pursuing a range of bilateral agreements in conjunction with this
