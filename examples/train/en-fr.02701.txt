mr president mrs kalniete wants to relaunch the single market and makes it sound like a v two rocket extremely dangerous but never on target
mr correia de campos is concerned about movement of workers
well so am i the eu has swamped the united kingdom with extra workers
the united kingdom sees the world as the market
the straightjacket of the eu regulation is closing our industry stopping innovation when it is ahead of the regulations and closing traditional industry where the product is good but different from the approved continental version
small business is the victim here
the united kingdom is amongst those which do comply yet it suffers because it does for example expensive compliance in the pig and egg industries with regulations that the commission will not enforce making our product uncompetitive
i have many more examples but have been allocated just one minute to save small businesses
