madam president once again we are indulging the fantasy that you can spend your way out of debt and legislate against recessions
at best we are engaging in self-deceit at worst we are deliberately perpetrating a deceit against our electorate
the truth is that nothing can stop this correction interest rates were held too low for too long and now that the air has been pumped into the balloon it is going to come out again
we could try to rescue some of the victims but instead we engage in this pretence that we can stop the thing happening
the debt will be paid by our children yet unborn and unbegot and nowhere more than in my country where every child is now born with a debt of gbp thirty zero because of the incompetence and incontinence of its government
as our national poet says this land of such dear souls this dear dear land is now leased out i die pronouncing it like to a tenement or pelting farm
and now on top of that national debt we are expected to contribute to these european recovery programmes
i close again with the words of our national poet prevent it resist it let it not be so lest child child's children cry against you woe
