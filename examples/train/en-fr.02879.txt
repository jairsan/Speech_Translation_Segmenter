mr president for an arrest warrant there has to be prima facie evidence
you cannot execute an arrest warrant without the judiciary understanding what the simple facts of the case are
in the andrew symeou case the underlying problems i say to gerard batten were procedural problems the detention periods and court system after the arrest warrant was executed
you talk about the appeal procedure
it was the period after the execution of the arrest warrant which was problematic and which we are trying to fix today in this debate
