mr president i did say a decade ago that you could not have greece and germany put together in the same monetary union and that it would not work
if you go back through history you find that when people are put together in false currency unions when governments think they know better than the markets governments always lose
you ask me what my solution is today
it is absolutely as plain as a pikestaff
greece portugal and ireland do not fit inside the euro
what we should be doing what mr van rompuy should be doing in order to give real leadership is to be introducing a plan b and to allow these countries to go back to their own currency to have competitive devaluations and to have a chance because what we are doing with this policy is killing them off
