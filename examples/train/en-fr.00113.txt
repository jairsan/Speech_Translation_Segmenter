mr president yes as far as i am concerned because the request for a split vote was made by the pse group because it did not agree with the middle section
if my oral amendment is adopted and i am looking at the shadow of the pse group yes she agrees with me then they agree with the paragraph as a whole so we could vote on the paragraph as a whole
