madam president i have listened to my colleagues quite rightly highlighting the shortage of water lack of access to water the diseases that come from that
all that is fundamentally important for this water forum
i just wanted to raise the other side of that coin because those of us who were recently in guyana with the acp regional conference were made very aware of those countries which have too much water because of climate change
mr musacchio was talking about the climate change impact on water how it can contaminate how it can dry it up lose the access but here we have too much and we have to bear in mind what that does in terms of polluting water supplies and causing damage to crops and all the rest of it
so we have i believe to add to this list for the water forum the issue of forestation deforestation because unless we get that right we will go on having floods as well as droughts
