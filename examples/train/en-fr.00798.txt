madam president it would appear that there has been some error in the text published on the internet by parliament's services
it is incorrectly worded and inconsistent with the text which was actually tabled in the joint resolution by my group and others
i do not know whether you have been informed of this and whether you can take it into account but the text in paragraph two should read respecting the individual wishes of anyone living in camp ashraf as regards to their future
that is not what is actually published and that is what should be in the text
