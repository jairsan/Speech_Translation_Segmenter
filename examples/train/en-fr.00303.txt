madam president what we have in common here is a desire to protect health but we should remember that it is the farmers who produce the good fresh nourishing food that is the basis of our health
i come from a very wet country
my farmers struggle continually with fungal infestation
fungi unlike insects that come and go come and stay
to ban or impose diluted fungicides could make potato and grain farming impossible in ireland but this proposed legislation is already having another effect
already in our media there are articles promoting gm potato-growing as an answer to the eu restrictions on pesticides
which will be more damaging to bees and the environment the continued responsible use of pesticides as practised by irish farmers or gm
we are told pesticides might disrupt dna
gm is based on disrupting dna
it is more necessary than ever that we start with a full impact assessment
