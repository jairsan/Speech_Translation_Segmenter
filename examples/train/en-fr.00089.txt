following up the last question what is it that the council has to fear about a proper impact assessment so that we might know the real impact of your proposals on food production in europe
this affects both producers and consumers
producers and consumers have a lot to lose if pesticides which presently are vital to crop production are removed with no available substitute
what for example are potato-growers in northern europe with their wet climate to do when there is no substitute to deal with potato blight
are we simply to say too bad
are we to say to our consumers let's import from countries which have no regard for pesticide controls
really is it not time to reconsider and to make a proper impact assessment on these proposals
