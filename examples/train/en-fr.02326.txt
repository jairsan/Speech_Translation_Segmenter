let me tell you without any ambiguity that we fully support social dialogue
we do it at european level but afterwards we have to do it also at national level that is a member state responsibility
i have been actively promoting all this social dialogue with etuc with businesseurope and with other relevant partners
but in fact we are of the opinion that we should now create more incentives to work we have to address the situation of our labour markets
i think this is part of the structural reforms which are needed to increase europe's competitiveness
