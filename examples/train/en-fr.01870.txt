mr president i voted against the lyon report because all over europe governments are cutting their budgets
in the united kingdom nurses and teachers face cuts in their pay and pensions
police numbers are being cut and prisoners are being released because we cannot afford to keep them in prison
yet here in the european parliament representatives of the conservative and liberal parties that make up the uk government somehow find it within themselves to vote to retain farming expenditure up to twenty thirteen and beyond twenty thirteen at twenty thirteen levels
i find that entirely unacceptable
i find it wrong that the agricultural community should be ring-fenced in a way that no other section of society is
if it is right for public servants to face reductions in their income then it is right for others in our society to face the same reductions
the government in the uk and governments across europe are saying we are all in this together
if we are in it together we all have to feel the pain together
