madam president article two hundred and eight of the lisbon treaty states that the main aim of european union development policy is poverty reduction and eradication
poverty is also the main reason for hunger
article two hundred and eight also states that the union shall take account of these objectives in other policies that might affect developing countries
however with export subsidies the eu is destroying markets in developing countries therefore causing poverty and hunger
if we want our development assistance to be effective we need to make sure that it is not hampered by other policies
otherwise we will not manage to meet the millennium development goals
we should keep that in mind when we review and reform policies such as the common agricultural policy and fisheries policies
