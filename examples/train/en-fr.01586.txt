mr president this young man has been kept in captivity for almost one four hundred days with absolute disrespect for any international norms and no access to him even by the red cross
i think this case should be seen and solved exclusively as a human tragedy
i am encouraged by the wide support in the european parliament for this debate and by the warm reception our colleagues expressed yesterday to shalit's father
shalit's case should not become a bargaining chip
instead it will be in the interests of hamas if they want to gain legitimacy in the peace process
to conclude the best proof for their credibility would be to release gilad shalit unconditionally and to abstain from further kidnappings
