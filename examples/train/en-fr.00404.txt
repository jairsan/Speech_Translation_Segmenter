mr president i am strongly of the opinion that the quality of the vehicle and skills of the driver are as important as if not more important than the length of journeys
two hours in a banger or clapped-out vehicle driven at excessive speed especially when cornering have far more serious welfare implications than eight or ten hours in a comfortable properly equipped modern lorry driven with care and consideration for the animal occupants
the welfare of horses for slaughter continues to be a serious concern and there is on-going evidence of some member states ignoring perhaps choosing to ignore the legislation in this area
commissioner have you received last june's annual report from ireland
which countries have failed to file the report
will these reports be available on the internet
and do you have details of the number of proceedings being brought in each member state
please give me answers to those four questions
