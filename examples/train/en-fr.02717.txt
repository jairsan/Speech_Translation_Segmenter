mr president this is a disease in respect of which farmers should make their own decisions based on their own particular circumstances
as a uk farmer i will rely on veterinary recommendation and not the opinion of bureaucrats in other countries
i appreciate the support of the british taxpayer who funds my vaccines and i am frustrated that the eu needs to be involved at all
you gave us this disease
please do not make matters worse
we are now discussing this question despite assurances that the lisbon treaty did not constitute a fundamental change
if that is so why do so many measures large and small like this one have to be recast to conform to the treaty on the functioning of the european union
we do not know how the issue of correlation tables is going to be resolved and this topic perfectly illustrates the confusion that so-called codecision can lead to
whilst the british government will spend what it takes to conform to your way of thinking other member states may view things very differently
