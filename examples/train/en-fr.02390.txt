mr president the murder of governor salmaan taseer is not only a private tragedy but a tragedy for democracy in pakistan
all the deplorable incidents and cases that have been outlined in the resolution altogether constitute an intimidating sign of pakistani society's reluctance to move towards secularisation and of the rise of religious extremism
how can pakistan even call itself a democracy when the freedom of religion that is granted by the constitution is completely ignored by applying the blasphemy laws to which the late salmaan taseer was so opposed
i would like the european union to consider the ramifications of the application of such inhumane laws on relations with pakistan
pakistan would benefit in many aspects by repealing the blasphemy laws and revoking the penalties that have been based on those laws
i also would expect the government of pakistan to reinforce the measures that have been taken to fight the spread of violent extremism
violence causes violence and i am quite confident that pakistan cannot afford the escalation of a full-scale civil war with extremist groupings such as the taliban
