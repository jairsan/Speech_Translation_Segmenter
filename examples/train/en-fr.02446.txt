mr president the rapid developments in north africa and the middle east have shaken i hope our type of confidence that europe is so prosperous and secure that it does not have to fear any major security challenge
only this time time has the bad habit of not stopping and what appears impossible today suddenly becomes a reality tomorrow
the problem we are discussing is both technical and political
let me refer to the letter which says that now with the increasing numbers of refugees from north africa in the wake of the current revolutionary developments there the eu is caught between its public support for them and the quiet necessity to keep its gates closed
all i want to say is that if we want to remain credible the solution to our technical problem which goes beyond money and police should be consistent with our public pronouncements
therefore harsh measures of the type some members have recently taken against people from other eu member states if adopted will only discredit the eu this time not only internally but also externally
