mr president has this house no sense of self-awareness
we pass a resolution condemning totalitarianism and then seconds later we pass a resolution calling on brussels to fund cultural policy in the regions
my friends culture cannot be created by bureaucratic fiat
it grows organically it develops naturally within a people and in its way this report precisely demonstrates the structural flaw at the heart of the european project
the brussels institutions are not rooted in any nation in any demos in any cultural unit
but rather than accepting that and trying to suit our institutions to public opinion we attempt to suit public opinion to our pre-existing institutions
if we really want to win our publics over we cannot do it by subsidising folk dancing
the way of doing it is by treating their opinions with respect and that means as you see i have not yet said it today putting the lisbon treaty to a vote
