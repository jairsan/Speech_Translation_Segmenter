i thank the presidency for their answer but notwithstanding the awaited report by the high-level group if the role of the world trade organisation means anything should it not include at the very least a unified process for safety assessment and authorisation of gm products traded at global level
because surely we are not saying that the united states australian and japanese consumers are put at greater risk by their gm safety assessment procedures and authorisations which are extremely efficient
finally would the presidency not agree that anything other than peer-reviewed science-based safety assessment and authorisation procedures for gmos would lack integrity and bring our legislation in this house into disrepute
