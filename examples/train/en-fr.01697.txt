mr president i want to talk about a lack of ambition that i see in this eu twenty twenty strategy for the way in which we can use the instruments which we have now the single market to get it to work very effectively and create those new jobs and opportunities the sort of thing that mrs turunen was talking about
it is not good enough and i say this to president and council if the commissioner is listening to put the single market and its achievement under this heading missing links and bottlenecks
it is far more important than that colleagues
and it is simply not good enough to say that the commission will propose action it is a shared venture between commission and member states
my committee the internal market committee passed a report this week with a huge majority which sets out some really ambitious ideas for joint action to complete the single market
you will receive that next week in conjunction with professor monti's report
let us see some fundamental changes in here both parties
what we want is a single market act a set of clear political objectives to complete the single market and we also want to see public procurement a massively underused tool to achieve those objectives of innovation and green technology
it is hardly mentioned in this document
for heaven's sake why are we talking about these other targets when we are not actually moving on what we have already
