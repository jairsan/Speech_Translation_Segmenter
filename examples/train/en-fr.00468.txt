mr president i would also like to compliment mr florenz on his effort and commitment in producing this report and of course on his ability to listen to and understand the many varied and different opinions
as legislators it is paramount in the midst of a massive economic downturn that we work on results for green energy technology
we can become world leaders in our diverse renewable energy fields which should create a tight effective and coordinated strategy including governments ngos academia business forward-thinkers seeking not to talk but to solve
we need to reduce bureaucracy and support smes and technology developers
the market is there
the regulatory framework is clear
we have set the targets for renewable energy
although funding is scarce it is crucial to technology development and to maintaining expertise
banks and funders will have to take risks on green technology start-ups
there will be long-term gain if we step up to the mark
the jobs and wealth will flow
if on the other hand we dilly-dally during this precious time we will lose out and other countries will be only too ready to fill the gap
for example ireland could become to ocean wave technology what finland is to mobile phone technology
we have the undisputed potential due to weather and location in the atlantic
we have the technology patented
we have the expertise in situ and we have the legal target framework
the market is clear so it is a magnificent opportunity for job creation electricity price reduction energy security and carbon emission reduction not to mention patent revenues
we now need to get behind our companies who have been working for over a decade to come to this point
they have taken the risks and we need to support them through increased funding
delays at this point would be detrimental
green technology is our future
we have the opportunity now so let us use it
