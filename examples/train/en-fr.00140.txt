madam president this timeshare law is long overdue
the committee on the internal market and consumer protection first held a hearing on this in two thousand and one exposing all the problems in the market
we are of course very pleased that we have come to the point today where we are now delivering for consumers
we are extending the law to cover all timeshare-like products especially the problematic discount holiday clubs
we are covering resale and exchange and giving consumers better protection and better rights
critically i believe consumers will have the same rights whether they are buying in varna on the black sea or valencia on the costa blanca
with this law consumers must be given the key information on the standard information sheet including all fees and charges and if the company fails to provide it the law extends the right of withdrawal to three months
failure to inform the consumer of the right of withdrawal extends the right of withdrawal to one year
these really are good rights for consumers
they will turn our traders into responsible traders and we will have informed and protected consumers which means we can drive out of the market the dodgy dealers and the scam merchants
today we have demonstrated that when consumers complain parliament's committee on internal market and consumer protection not only answers but we act and we deliver
commissioner i would ask you to follow up as you always do on enforcement issues
we must now use the new cross-border enforcement network to tackle the continuing problems that consumers have and to make sure we reduce the number of complaints that turn up on timeshare in european consumer centres right across the twenty-seven member states
