mr president i voted in favour of this resolution because in my view the european parliament has to demonstrate that it takes seriously the issues of security the fight against terrorism and organised and transnational crime
we are also serious in taking into account our relations with partners such as the united states canada and australia
after the entry into force of the lisbon treaty the european parliament now has to give its consent to the agreements between the eu and third countries on the transfer of passenger name record pnr data with a view to concluding those agreements
we must therefore use this power responsibly
in the light of the fact that parliament has already decided once on five may this year to postpone the vote on the request for consent for the agreements with the usa and australia and that the current eu-canada agreement on the transfer of pnr is no longer valid we should make sure that when the time comes we give the green light to these important measures which will enhance security in the transatlantic area and beyond
