mr president i echo your words and compliment ms mazzoni for her work on this resolution which i fully support
in all the hustle and bustle of this week in strasbourg the one meeting which was the most important was sadly the one that i had the least time for
that was the women from iran who are here looking for support for their colleagues and for this resolution
but i was very glad to meet with them and to make a commitment of support
it is staggering but perhaps noteworthy that we received many more e-mails on the issue of animal welfare than we did on this issue about human life
i just make that remark for what it is worth
i think we should say because we were asked to use this word in particular that many of the women who are condemned to execution by stoning and otherwise are condemned for the crime of which literally means someone at war with god
but actually all that these women have done is to protest against a dictatorship in their country and to desire to bring about change for the better for themselves and to restore their rights in that particular country
so i stand here in support of those women
there is very little that i can do but i think this parliament in its huge vote today speaks volumes and i hope it will make a difference
