mr president united kingdom producers have been investing substantial sums of money pushing up their production costs in preparing for the implementation of this directive because they know that britain will implement the law
why should they have to face unfair competition from countries that fail to implement the law or possibly are granted exemption or delayed enforcement
the measure has been drafted with the barest minimum of enforcement left to the precious care of greatly varying standards in twenty-seven member states
the language is hardly suggestive of uniformly severe enforcement
words like proportionate and dissuasive have been used
i am not in favour of the eu passing laws on behalf of member states at all
however if such laws are passed it is not acceptable for some countries to be forced to comply and others granted effective exemption
will the commission ensure that countries that fail to comply will be prevented from exporting eggs to countries that do comply or at least that eggs from non-complying units will not be exported
our producers are demanding protection from unfair competition
