mr president i congratulate mr kirilov and mr kazak on their work
if our relations are seen purely through the prism of our need for oil and gas we will exacerbate tensions and fail to achieve security in other senses
it is the need for peace and economic development in the south caucasus which should drive our policy that means engaging with nato to ensure their new strategic concept reflects this engaging with russia and turkey as powers in the region to seek to maximise agreement and extending the true hand of friendship to the people through association agreements and visa arrangements and so on
we should welcome the statement of mr medvedev and mr yanukovich on moldova which shows how much can be achieved through diplomacy and i congratulate commissioner f√ºle on the development of the eastern neighbourhood partnership so far
i look forward as the european union develops a common foreign and security policy to a more active engagement of the union on all aspects of relations with the black sea region
