mr president over a year ago a group of meps the rapporteur and myself got together in brussels for an informal meeting with a common aim to do something about h one n one
as the meetings continued i found that our objectives were the same but that we had a different approach
the own-initiative report was an opportunity for parliament to take positive action in preparation for an epidemic
i fear it has been an opportunity lost
there are many points in this report that are of questionable value
it proposes a role for the ecdc which is not feasible and it could lead to a false sense of security
what was needed was a lessons learned approach and a basis to build on that
what we got was partly a name and shame report which i fear will alienate many of the stakeholders
what we got was a report that was more political than practical
