mr president we are talking about food information to consumers
as members of this house we get information on many things and it is not so much the information but what we do with it that is crucial
i want to address two specific points in this report
one is country of origin
we do have country of origin labelling for beef
perhaps the union would not have chosen to have it but a crisis forced us to have it
it seems to have worked very effectively and very well
i support the idea that particularly in relation to meat products there is a need for country of origin information for consumers so that they know where their food comes from
let me move on to my second point the issue where i would give an amber light
i have read and indeed thank those who have given me the information about traffic lights and gdas and i have tried to analyse this information extremely carefully
i have a number of points to make
we have health warnings on cigarette packs
i do not smoke i think the warnings are wonderful and i will not smoke
those who smoke continue to smoke through all the alarming warnings that are on the labels
can i stress that labels will not make you thin
labels will not reduce obesity
we need a much deeper discussion around this problem
we should ban lifts and cars so that we get more exercise but we are hardly likely to take that particular route
i am glad this is a first reading
i think the issues are too complex to solve at this stage
we need a deeper debate and discussion and to come up with something that is in the best interests of the title of the report food information to consumers
