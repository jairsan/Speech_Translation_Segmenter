madam president this is a bad piece of legislation not as bad as it might have been but nonetheless bad
like so much employment regulation in this parliament it is introduced in the name of workers rights and yet its main effect will be to deny thousands upon thousands of people the right to work at all
it makes our labour markets less competitive and less flexible
it damages our economies at the very time we can least afford to have them damaged
temporary work is widely and correctly recognised as a ladder back into permanent employment for those workers who for some reason have been temporarily out of the labour market
what we are doing in this house today is kicking away that ladder which helped workers back into employment
the british government has been resisting this measure for a long time but has finally found itself unable to resist it
you could not ask for a clearer example of the way the eu subverts democracy in member states
