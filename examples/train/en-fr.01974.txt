mr president the commission proposed this directive in two thousand and eight and there were concerns about placing excessive burdens on the scientific research industry
the proposal will dilute certain restrictions and i note that the requirement for sharing animal research data has been removed
some twelve million animals are being used in experiments in the eu each year and this proposal could increase their suffering
we must reduce the need for experimentation on animals
civilised human beings will try to strike a balance between the need for research and the obligation to respect the lives of other creatures on this planet
these decisions require the wisdom of solomon
i regret i have to say i have to ask the question does the eu parliament have such wisdom
