mr president this is becoming a bit of a familiar refrain to agree with my colleagues
i voted against this report because of course i also completely reject the whole concept of european citizenship
i believe that citizenship is unique to nation states and i believe that all of the efforts that are behind this attempt to construct a european citizenship are related to the same attempts to conduct a european superstate
many of my constituents and myself are also unhappy about being forced to become effectively european citizens
they see citizenship as something to be affirmed or rejected based on a common set of values and ideals built up over the centuries
none of us have been given any say any referendum or any consultation whatsoever on whether we wish or do not wish to become european citizens
of course there should be a referendum on the lisbon treaty
but we should also be asked whether we wish to be european citizens in addition to our nation citizenship
we have no right to renounce european citizenship even if we completely reject as i do the whole concept of such a thing
