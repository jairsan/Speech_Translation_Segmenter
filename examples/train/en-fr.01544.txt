mr president in view of the second roma summit i would like to share with you a couple of ideas in the hope that they will take effect as soon as possible
firstly i strongly believe we need a broad and coherent strategy on roma inclusion and we also need an action plan with clear benchmarks and appropriate budgeting
in my view it should be a strategy not only for the eu member states but also for other countries where roma communities live and which are either in the enlargement process or in the neighbourhood policy thus allowing the eu to use the most appropriate tools available to it on roma policies
secondly i am convinced that we must apply the lessons learned from the gender equality policy namely mainstreaming
roma mainstreaming <unk> become the working approach of all eu institutions
thirdly when it comes to the expertise on roma we should consider some affirmative actions especially hiring roma experts in the council the commission and parliament
it is on this note that i have prepared letters to president van rompuy and president barroso recommending them to lead by example and hire roma advisors
