the global financial and economic crisis has negatively impacted on bilateral trade between the eu and the eastern partner countries
overall trade between the eu and six eastern partner countries declined between two thousand and eight and twenty ten by twenty
it must be recalled that the eastern partnership started being implemented when the financial crisis was in full swing
its launching summit took place on seven may two thousand and nine
in this early period working structures were created and some first meetings of the multilateral platforms were being held
the eastern partnership was simply too young to soften the negative effects of the financial and economic crisis
as for the role of the black sea synergy on trade with the eu it can be said that it has been negligible as the black sea synergy initiative is a regional cooperation framework not a trade arrangement
the south caucasus countries individually or as a group have not played any particular role in the development of trade between the eu and the eastern partnership countries
preparations for future negotiations of a bilateral deep and comprehensive free trade area are ongoing with georgia and armenia while the trade provisions of the partnership and cooperation agreement with azerbaijan are currently being upgraded
