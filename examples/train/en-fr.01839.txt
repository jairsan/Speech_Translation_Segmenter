mr president i am quite confident that bulgaria and romania will do their utmost to reach the target date for lifting the internal border controls in march twenty eleven
the commission within its competences will fully support both countries in order for them to successfully pass the schengen evaluation
it is the responsibility of the council to carry out the schengen evaluations and based on these evaluations the council will decide on the lifting of internal border controls
these evaluations are ongoing so it is too early to assess the state of play of the preparations
but the first steps have been successful confirmed by the positive evaluation of data protection which allows now bulgaria and romania to get access to the schengen information system
the european parliament and mr coelho propose that bulgaria and romania should inform council and parliament on the follow-up recommendations
it is indeed the practice in the current schengen evaluation that the member states concerned report to the council on the measures to comply with the recommendations as the evaluation mechanism is now under full responsibility of the council
on that basis and under current legislation it is up to the council to inform parliament accordingly
in this context i would like to take up your proposal and confirm that i will soon in the autumn propose a new evaluation mechanism following the entry into force of the lisbon treaty for the reasons that you stated mr coelho
i think that both member states and parliament should be involved in this mechanism
member states of course shall be involved to maintain mutual trust among each other on their capacity to apply all accompanying measures allowing for the lifting of internal border control in particular in the field of external borders visa and police cooperation
the european parliament should indeed be fully informed of the outcome of these results of the evaluation
with this new mechanism the commission aims to remedy the current weaknesses as referred to by the rapporteur
there is no real follow-up at this time after evaluations are made and the recommendations are not always implemented
the support of parliament in this process is indeed very much appreciated
