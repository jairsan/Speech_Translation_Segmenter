mr president i wish to express my concern that we have been prevented from debating the brok amendment on implementation of the members statute
elmar brok proposed that responsibility be transferred from the bureau which meets in private to the parliament which meets in public
i believe that our constituents have a right to know not only what we pay ourselves but also the details of the allowances and benefits that we receive
i find it regrettable that you sir as our president think otherwise
more disturbing is that fearful of losing a vote or perhaps fearful of having a vote at all you resort to a procedural device to prevent debate
that is undemocratic and at a time when everyone talks about making the eu more transparent and closer to its citizens this move smacks of hypocrisy
if the european union is to increase transparency we need to take action and not just mouth platitudes on the subject
it is simply not acceptable to treat our constituents like mushrooms to keep them in the dark and cover them with fertiliser
i can assure you sir that this issue will not go away and you will have to face a vote sooner or later
