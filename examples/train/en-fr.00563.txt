madam president the reason i want to give an explanation of vote on this particular report is because i cannot believe the hypocrisy of this house in talking as it always does about climate change
why is this house hypocritical
well look around you
we are in our second chamber
we have a perfectly good chamber back in brussels
we are here for only three or four days per month
i admit that we are going to get an extra part-session this particular month but only to average out for the one in twelve sessions that we need to do
we have hundreds of people displaced from their normal places of work to come here
they travel and cause carbon emission while they are getting here
we are possibly the least green parliament that there is
when i entered this place it was meant to be a paperless parliament yet if you look around all our desks are covered in paper
we are the worst hypocrites when it comes to this than any chamber i know
