mr president european citizens are gravely concerned about the effects of climate change and support a low-carbon clean energy provision for our future
it is therefore right that we send a strong signal to the council of our common commitments
however the people we represent are also gravely concerned about the global financial crisis
for them job security has certainly become a more pressing issue than global warming and renewable energy at least for now
we cannot allow the state of europe's economies nevertheless to push climate change off the agenda
equally we cannot further undermine our key industries and labour markets by taking hasty actions
on the whole i believe that this package the triple twenty climate change package reflects this dilemma and it reduces the risk that european industries will have to relocate abroad to less restrictive jurisdictions
the city of london which i represent is also very keen to trade carbon permits under the ets
taking a common approach to addressing climate change is also at the heart of my party's approach to the european union under david cameron who is our party leader and hopefully the next prime minister of britain
