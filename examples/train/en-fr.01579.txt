mr president i welcome and support both reports and i congratulate both rapporteurs on those documents
now for two points
firstly on the danjean report i would like to bring up an issue that has raised a lot of eyebrows in a number of eu member states
i am talking specifically about the exclusive talks between paris and moscow over the possible sale of four mistral warships to russia
the mistral warship is clearly offensive in nature and it is indeed very alarming that some eu member states are engaging in arms sales to third countries which might have very negative consequences for the security of other eu member states or the eu's neighbours
the treaty of lisbon outlines common defence aspirations and includes a clause about solidarity in the area of security and defence
therefore what do you reckon parliament and other eu institutions should push for
a common set of rules inside the eu addressing arms sales from eu member states to third countries
as regards mr albertini's report i would like to stress the importance of stability and security in east asia
we welcome the efforts undertaken by both taipei and beijing to improve cross-state relations and to enhance dialogue and practical cooperation
in this context the eu should strongly back taiwan's participation in the international civil aviation organisation and in the united nations framework convention on climate change as taiwan's participation in these organisations is important to the eu and global interests
