mr president i should like to thank everyone for the helpful and constructive way that we have conducted this debate today
the overwhelming majority of you with only one or two notable exceptions were very much in favour of my report on early years learning and the other reports we debated today
i think we have really put down a marker for the future that education is extremely important
it is not only important for children for the very young children i have been talking about and the young people that my colleague has been talking about but it is also important for the future of europe
i therefore strongly support what the commissioner has said that member states should now continue to invest in education and should not be using the economic climate to make cuts because making cuts in education would be the worse possible thing to do
education is about our future it is about having adults who are employable who are fit who are healthy who are not a drain on our social services
we understand that and we have got to convey that message back to our member states so that they can exercise their subsidiarity to make sure that what we have been talking about here is actually put into practice
