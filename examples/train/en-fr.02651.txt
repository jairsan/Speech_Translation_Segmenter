mr president a year ago in haiti there was a feeling that the eu was slow off the mark in disaster and humanitarian relief
are you satisfied by the degree of operational coordination between the eu and member states in the recent emergencies especially in japan
what has happened since the commission communication of three years ago on reinforcing the union's disaster response capacity which said that we needed greater coherence and effectiveness for a more integrated eu disaster response capacity
in particular has recent experience in japan and a rather different one in north africa helped to advance commission thinking on whether we need an eu rapid reaction mechanism for humanitarian disaster and reconstruction aid
