mr president i would have loved to have voted for the muscardini report on female genital mutilation because i have supported a ban on this barbaric practice for many years and i am also supporting a family's case because they are threatened with this practice if they go back to their home country
however as habitually happens colleagues use the plight of mutilated girls and women to promote once again the abortion agenda by slipping in the mantra of sexual and reproductive rights in this report
