madam president i would like to thank you all for this interesting debate
i think it is very necessary regarding our future relations with russia and a number of important points have been covered in the debate
i can support much of what has been said here
for those who speak of the need for engagement i think it is clear that a new agreement is of great importance for the further development and intensification of cooperation between the eu and russia
it is also clear that the new agreement must continue to improve on the current partnership and cooperation agreement pca
it has to reflect the realities of today's cooperation with russia
our relations now are a lot deeper and more wide-ranging than they were only a decade ago
for those who speak of energy we must clearly state that the eu wishes to strengthen cooperation with russia through the instruments we have the meetings of the energy dialogue and the permanent partnership council on energy
there will be a meeting of the permanent partnership council on energy during this presidency
the objective is to promote trust and transparency in eu-russia energy relations
we cannot afford another disruption of the energy supply
we should also strengthen the early warning mechanism and make it more operative
to those who speak of human rights i think that the application of the rule of law an independent judiciary and full respect for human rights including free and independent media are necessary to promote stability and prosperity in russia
the eu follows the human rights situation in russia with concern and we raise and will continue to raise those concerns at our eu-russia meetings
for example the conduct of cases such as the resumption of the khodorkovsky trial will be a kind of litmus paper for us regarding the rule of law in russia
for those who speak of leverage i agree very much that we have to speak with one voice when talking with russia and we need this kind of debate to shape the form of this one voice
unity and solidarity are essential and we will work very hard to achieve this
it is important that the member states inform and consult each other as much as possible about bilateral issues with russia which could have repercussions on other member states and the eu as a whole
parliament's suggestions in this regard are worth considering although given the existing council structures i am not entirely sure that the creation of a formal consultation mechanism is the most practical way forward
i strongly feel however that some kind of mechanism or common approach is needed to complement the existing framework of eu-russia relations
there is definitely some room for improvement in our policy towards russia and unity and solidarity are indeed the key words in this context
we already have quite intensive political consultation in the council when it comes to showing solidarity but this is also a question of political will
i agree that we need greater trust and understanding between the eu and russia
we need to overcome the suspicions of the past and build on the real and substantial relationship which has evolved over the years but this is certainly a two-way process and we need two to tango
the new agreement is one way to do this
the other is through a better dialogue
parliament has an important role to play here and i can therefore agree with the suggestion that the role of the parliamentary cooperation committee should be strengthened under the new agreement
the parliamentary dimension like civil society contacts has much to offer in terms of communicating and promoting the fundamental democratic principles and values on which the eu is founded
we therefore look forward to remaining in a dialogue with you as the negotiations progress
