mr president like many other colleagues within this chamber this morning i would appeal for honesty and realism in the debate in relation in particular to turkey
i welcome those colleagues who have asked for proactive support for cyprus in reaching some sort of resolution with turkey
i want to turn our attention very quickly to one aspect of this that has come to my attention and that is the plight of many of the citizens whom i represent who are suffering grave financial loss as a result of property scams within turkey
since i became an mep in july i have been contacted by many constituents who have invested substantial sums of money in properties ranging from eur fifty zero to eur one hundred and fifty zero and who have subsequently lost out on that investment in what in many cases looks like blatant fraudulent activity
i would request that the commission look into this and act proactively in relation to it
