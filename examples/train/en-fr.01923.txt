madam president a large group of people in this parliament have worked extremely hard on this report
we have compromised and broadly agreed on five priorities to improve the commission text better governance good work and equal pay for equal work sub-targets for vulnerable groups gender equality and cohesion policy
all our hard work will have been in vain though if the council decides to simply disregard it
they can if they choose to
mr chastel i would like to ask you whether you will do your very best for our priorities
also i would like to know whether it is true that our priorities stand a better chance of being adopted in the recitals as mrs milquet has indicated
this is vital to know for our vote tomorrow
of my colleagues i want to ask that we all stick to our compromises
we are no match for council if we stand divided
the greens will certainly stand by our commitment and we count on all of you to do the same
