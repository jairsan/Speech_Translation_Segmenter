madam president the violence in the republic of moldova was not a revolution but a mutiny which took place within a revolutionary atmosphere in a divided society
that violence could also be seen as having been provoked and used as part of a strategy with the aim of redrawing the borders between the european union and eurasia
therefore the problem we have to cope with is a european problem
it is not a mere internal or a single member state problem
however the solution to that problem must not be retaliation but the multiplication of efforts for engaging moldova on a european way
nor is the solution to encourage the moldovan elites to leave the country as holders of foreign passports
to this end we must strengthen the mission of the european union envoy for moldova both in scope and resources accelerate negotiation with moldova on visa facilitations and deepen cooperation in the field of enhancing both public order and respect for human rights
we have to work together with the authorities the opposition and civil society but also with russia which has an important presence in the region
we should avoid these events being taken as an excuse for a unilateral solution on transnistria
