having read the three questions twenty-three from higgins twenty-four from mitchell and twenty-five from gallagher i can only assume that the commissioner would have grouped those three together and therefore can we not or have you the right to trespass on the next debate
because at all times it is question time that suffers
so if we can trespass maybe the commissioners will be good enough to give us some more of their time after nine o clock
