mr president it is frightening to imagine a nuclear device small in size but potentially lethal for millions of people falling into the hands of terrorists
some years back we could say that this was highly unlikely
we cannot say this any longer
countries like iran and north korea are in the process of acquiring or have the capability to acquire a nuclear weapon
a scientist from pakistan has allegedly sold know-how to iran and north korea has traded in nuclear material
nobody is against iran acquiring nuclear energy for peaceful purposes but patience is running thin if iran is buying time in the dialogue with the five one which we support
the dual-track approach and the preparation of smart targeted sanctions by the un security council are warranted
nuclear proliferation is at such a critical point that it has led personalities like henry kissinger to argue that only the move towards total elimination will ensure non-proliferation and global security
so we support an international treaty for the progressive elimination of nuclear weapons a halt to the production of fissile material bringing forward the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty the reduction of nuclear warheads start etc
bringing all treatment of nuclear fuel under the control of the iaea and strengthening its mandate and its verification powers
