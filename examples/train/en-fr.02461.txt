mr president my father is a small businessman
he owns an electrical company and was only given the opportunity to set up this company due to the tax breaks and opportunities given to him by the conservative prime minister and true eurosceptic margaret thatcher back in the nineteen eighties
like all small businessmen he is overburdened with red tape and regulation much of it emanating from this place the european parliament
my father's small business remains small
however these kinds of businesses are the bedrock of the british economy and they amount to a staggering seventy-three of all businesses in the uk
my father drives a van and like many small businesses he is struggling due to the recession
i have a grave concern that this legislation will put small businesses like my father's out of business for ever because we are told that this legislation will in fact put up to eur five zero on the price of vans
small businessmen can ill afford this cost at a time of economic strife
the gentleman from the socialists said that this is a good day for climate change policy in the eu
however if this goes through i guarantee it will be a bad day for small businessmen across the continent
