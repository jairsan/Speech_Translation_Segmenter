mr president i would like to salute the directive under discussion for taking an important step towards simplifying the bureaucracy of the national regimes on defence-related transfers within the community
i appreciate that the directive will accomplish its objective diminishing uncertainty concerning the circulation of this type of product throughout the community while retaining national decision-making in the matter
it will also help bring about even if not directly uniformisation and standardisation in a very diverse market thus ultimately helping integration in the field of defence security and foreign policy within our union
the problem will be in practical application meaning that the standards now introduced should not be nullified through exceptions which in turn cannot be completely eliminated given the sensitivity of the matter
i conclude by saying that the directive under discussion or rather its future improvement will also be useful in indicating the limits of further integration in the field of defence and security acceptable to the member states at a given moment in time
