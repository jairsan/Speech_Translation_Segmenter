i would not say in existence frankly speaking
turkey has made progress in terms of rule of law
however we do not believe that it is yet compatible in its standard of respect of fundamental rights and the rule of law with european standards
this is precisely part of the work we have been developing with turkey over the years
each year because turkey is a candidate country to the european union the commission assesses in very objective terms the reforms made by turkey in the rule of law and all matters related to fundamental rights
there has been progress in some areas to be fair
there are other areas where we are requesting more efforts from the turkish authorities
i believe that keeping up this dialogue and in fact these negotiations for turkey's accession is indeed the right way to make progress in the matter of respect of fundamental rights and generally speaking the rule of law and democratic reforms in turkey
