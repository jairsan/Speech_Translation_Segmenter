mr president russian exile pavel stroilov recently published revelations about the collaboration between the british labour party and the soviet union during the cold war
soviet archival documents state that in the nineteen eighties neil kinnock as leader of the opposition approached mikhail gorbachev through secret envoys to see how the kremlin would respond if a labour government stopped the implementation of the trident nuclear missile programme
if the report given to mr gorbachev is true it means that lord kinnock approached one of britain's enemies in order to seek approval regarding his party's defence policy and if elected britain's defence policy
if this report is true then lord kinnock would be guilty of treason
the documents now available must be investigated at the highest possible level by the british authorities and lord kinnock given the opportunity to answer the soviet evidence
