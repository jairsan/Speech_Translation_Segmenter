mr president hgv haulage is integral to the supply process essential to a good economy
if added charges are levied across europe the extra cost is ultimately filtered to the consumer
the uk government is looking into hgv charges to bring us in line with europe by twenty fifteen
we do not have a network of toll roads nor do we lay additional charges on heavy goods vehicles after road tax
we face unfair competition from an increasing number of foreign trucks taking up more than their fair share of cross-border haulage
foreign operators pay nothing to use our roads but uk diesel duty is as much as twenty-three pence a litre higher giving competitors a fifteen advantage
however under eu law the uk cannot introduce a charge applicable only to foreign vehicles
if this directive expands its capabilities any move by the uk government to introduce hgv charges will be overshadowed by an unwanted indirect tax which the commission also reserves the right to make obligatory in twenty thirteen
as the proposals relate to taxation it should require unanimity at council level yet the legislation is being ushered in via the transport provision of lisbon
it is an underhand way of introducing indirect taxation and should not be voted through by anybody with a democratic bone in their body
