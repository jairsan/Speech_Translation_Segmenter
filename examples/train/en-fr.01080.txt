thank you very much firstly for taking my question i appreciate it very much
thank you also for your answer which was comprehensive
i think you have outlined very clearly the value of sport especially the health value of it and i am quite sure that when the lisbon treaty comes into being we can walk hand in hand to ensure that sport as a competence of the european union can get its fair share of promotion and publicity
