we are very concerned with this case
commissioner malmstr√∂m has already said that the suspension by libya of visas for citizens from the schengen area is a disproportionate measure
in addition this situation is not coherent with the positive trend of relations between libya and the european union
intense diplomatic efforts are ongoing to find a solution to the crisis
already one of the two swiss citizens has left libya
this is a positive step
the european union's foreign and justice ministers discussed the issue on twenty-two february and twenty-five february respectively and supported the continuation of diplomatic efforts
i believe that it is essential to keep dialogue open and make the effort of understanding each party's positions with a view to finding a solution as soon as possible
