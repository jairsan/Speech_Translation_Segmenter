mr president i would like to begin as honourable members have done by again congratulating mr salafranca for the excellent report and also as he has done and as others have done to thank the spanish presidency for the work that they too have undertaken in not only pulling together the work for the summit but all of the work that they have done to support the initiatives that have been undertaken
the forthcoming summit is an important one
it enables us to reinforce that relationship that honourable members have talked about
we will also be holding a foreign ministers meeting alongside the summit which is particularly important to me
i hope we will be able to use that occasion to deepen the relationship with a number of states who will be present at the time
a number of honourable members also talked about the importance of trade and the role of european businesses with which i am in complete agreement
we are the biggest investor in that region
i was particularly pleased that colleagues talked about the role of innovation which i think is especially important too
of course a huge emphasis as i would expect was placed on human rights the importance of making sure that is clearly part of all the dynamic relationships that we have and encompasses our work
honourable members talked about the particular point made in the report about feminicide and of course indigenous people
the commission has always defended the rights of indigenous people and will continue to monitor the projects that were being described
on colombia in particular i am very well aware of the views not only within this house but of course with the european tuc and the international tuc with which i have had links in my previous role
we are continuing to follow the situation very closely
we have taken note of the significant progress that has been made
within the trade agreement colleagues will see the importance of the robust human rights clause and the commitments that are made within that agreement which i hope as we monitor those will actually go some way to alleviating the concerns but certainly will be part of our continuing relationship with colombia
i also agree about the importance of the role that we play with these countries in broader international questions
brazil and iran were specific examples given
i have been in discussion with celso amorim the foreign minister of brazil precisely on that question and we continue to stay in touch about its importance
the falklands islands were raised
member states have ratified the un convention on the law of the sea
the falkland islands is an associated territory to the union and the rule of law would apply
climate change is also a very important issue
we should remember that we have a key dialogue with this region
finally i was also very pleased that erasmus and the importance of educational programmes in that context were mentioned
to end again my congratulations go to mr salafranca
