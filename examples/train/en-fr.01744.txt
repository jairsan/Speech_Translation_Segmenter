we are of course in constant dialogue with ukraine on this issue
my colleague commissioner štefan füle has presented a matrix of cooperation and i am very much involved in this as well
it does cover home affairs in order to see how we can help the ukrainian authorities to develop on these matters and how we can deepen our cooperation further
this will also be dealt with in a meeting with the ukrainian authorities in only a few weeks time
police cooperation and education as such are not foreseen in the immediate future but that could of course be discussed once ukraine has carried out the necessary reforms
we are open to cooperation with them
they are an important neighbour
we have lots in common
we have common challenges concerning cross-border crime so it would also be good for us if we could engage further in this
of course the ukrainians also need to improve but we are there and are ready to help and assist them and we will see what this will lead to in the longer term
