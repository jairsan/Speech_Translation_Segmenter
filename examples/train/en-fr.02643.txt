madam president i welcome this timely report from elisabeth jeggle and thank her for her good cooperation
not many people realise that forty-two of those engaged regularly in agriculture are women and that three out of every ten holdings in the eu are managed by women
in order for women and families to remain in the countryside and make their contribution to achieving the objectives of the eu twenty twenty strategy through agriculture there must be a range of services and facilities for normal everyday life
these services should include such things as healthcare and care services education leisure transport and broadband
it is crucial that all services are not just market-oriented
there also needs to be proper social insurance for women working in agriculture so that their future and their pensions can be guaranteed
it is also important for women's entrepreneurial skills to be facilitated and across the board for women to be involved in decision making at local and regional level in farm organisations and indeed in all decision-making bodies
that will have a huge impact and will help ensure women's future role in agriculture
