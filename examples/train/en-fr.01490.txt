madam president i fully appreciate your presence in the plenary this evening
i would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for our fruitful discussions and our work on this report
the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon is giving the european union more competence in the field of energy policy
i believe this is an area where if member states work together europe can ensure secure cheaper and more efficient energy for its citizens
together we can minimise the impact of unpredictable events such as the gas disruption europe experienced last winter
of course europe cannot interfere in gas flow outside its borders or solve such disputes but what we can do is ensure that our infrastructure is able to cope with supply shortages or failures and make the market more transparent and efficient
europe has set this priority very high on its agenda
last year we adopted a third energy package which aims to ensure a more competitive and efficient energy market
a regulation on the security of gas supplies is currently on the table in parliament and tomorrow's vote on the regulation on notification of investments in energy infrastructure will contribute to making the market more transparent and more predictable
in this context i think it would be a pity to waste the opportunity this new instrument offers by not applying the correct legal basis provided by the new article one hundred and ninety-four of the lisbon treaty
it is a very important institutional political and legal point
this regulation is not only a tool for collecting information it can also give an overall picture of investments in energy infrastructure as a basis for policy making
so in the event that the council adopts this regulation on the wrong legal basis i consider that parliament should pursue this matter further at the european court of justice and let me assure you it will
on the substance now i have said this before to mr barroso and i will say it again to you commissioner oettinger europe is standing at a turning point and our priority now should be more than ever to support our companies and create a positive environment for competitiveness
we therefore need strong policies and especially a stronger reliable energy policy
the aim in the end is to ensure secure and cheap energy for both our citizens and our companies
in this perceptive i should hope that gathering data will not become a purpose in itself
we have to make sure that this regulation will not create yet another bureaucratic burden on companies and that confidentiality of commercially sensitive information will be reinforced
on another issue i can only regret that the ppe and s d groups introduced an amendment requiring eu companies to provide data on investments in projects in third countries
i challenge anyone to find the legal basis in the treaties that would allow extra-territoriality in energy policy
furthermore i believe we should first start proving that we know what is planned at european level before looking outside our borders
i have also noticed the temptation in this house to include everything in this regulation
i think that this is a mistake
for this instrument to be efficient we must focus on real consistent information and keep in mind avoiding too much bureaucracy and confidentiality issues for our companies and the commission
i have tried to achieve this balance by on the one hand giving the commission the opportunity of having an overview of possible future developments but also on the other hand ensuring that this picture is as accurate as possible
we also need some certainty about future investments to ensure proper and solid policy making
i would also need to be reassured commissioner oettinger
i want to avoid a situation where the commission having gathered the data starts imposing investment plans and ends up telling companies not to invest here but there
however it should provide solutions and incentives for companies to make short-term non-profitable investments which may be needed to ensure security of supply otherwise the loopholes will remain
i am stopping here
thank you for your time and i look forward to hearing your comments
