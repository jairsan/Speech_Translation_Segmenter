mr president in the brutal war of the sri lanka government against the tamil minority at least forty zero tamils were killed within the space of a few weeks and hundreds of thousands were detained in open air prison camps
the un report at long last publicly acknowledges the crimes that were committed against the tamil people
unfortunately there should be no illusions that the report will change the conditions of tamils in sri lanka
the day after its publication it was reported that the un secretary-general would only launch an international investigation if the sri lankan government agrees or an international forum such as the un foreign security council calls for an inquiry
given the nature of the sri lankan government it is obvious that it will not allow any international investigation
it highlights once again the need to campaign for a genuinely independent inquiry into the war crimes and for the rajapaksa regime to be held responsible
on eighteen may there will be protests around the world organised by many groups including the tamil solidarity campaign to mark the second anniversary of this bloody war
a united struggle of sinhalese and tamil people is still needed to defeat this regime and fight for the right of self-determination for the tamil-speaking people
