madam president twenty years ago the romanians were dying for freedom including in education which until then was subject to tight political control
as a result of their sacrifice universities have gained their freedom too which they have enjoyed ever since
it would therefore be sadly ironic if the current attempt by the romanian ministry of education to speedily pass new legislation which practically eliminates that freedom and opens the door to the repoliticisation of the system were successful
for instance in the draft the rectors elected would have to be confirmed by the minister who is himself a political appointee and universities would be forced to merge on arbitrary criteria or could even be closed and their assets repossessed
as a professor myself and as an mep i consider it my duty to my fellow professors in this house to expose such intended undemocratic practices that are openly opposed to the lisbon strategy on education and cannot be tolerated in an eu member state
