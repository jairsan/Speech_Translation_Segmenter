mr president whether it is the coordinated sniper attack or the protest camp in sana a yemen on fifteen march the crackdown on the protests by one hundred zero people in dara syria on seventeen march or the sixth floor of salmaniya hospital bahrain where injured protestors are taken by men in balaclavas wielding guns never to return and where the injured are forced to go because it has the only blood bank in the country we have to show that while the media may only concentrate on one country at a time this parliament will stand up for human rights everywhere where they are under threat
today we must call on the foreign affairs council to seek clear accountability for all those responsible for the violence independent investigations and no impunity
this is the basic warning to prevent further violence against protestors now
secondly when we hear that bahraini security forces have fired supposedly non-lethal pellets at a distance of less than one metre killing protestors by literally splitting their heads in half we have to suspend the authorisation supply and transfer of all arms in the region
finally the principles of commissioner f√ºle's communication on the southern neighbourhood must inform our approach to the process of seeking an association agreement with syria
that has to start by our insisting on unhindered access for international human rights monitors now
the arab world has changed with the jasmine revolution and we have to show that we have changed with it
