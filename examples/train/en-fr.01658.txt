mr president as has already been said no one could have predicted the recent events in iceland
the airline industry is having to cope with very unpredictable circumstances both in terms of the volcanic eruption and of course the general economic background
with this in mind we should base such an extreme measure of shutting all european airspace on proper scientific evidence and with the current technology available make sure that disruption is minimal and information is communicated efficiently
in this respect eurocontrol and national authorities have added to the frustration with their poor management of this crisis
continually pushing back the closure of europe's airspace every six to eight hours has meant that passengers could not plan journeys by other means and airlines themselves have been kept waiting for progress
computer modelling and satellite technology are available to aid these situations but even with all of this technology we still seem to have been in a position of almost licking our finger and sticking it in the air to see which way the wind is blowing
at least that is the way the public perceives it
this has been a disaster for all concerned
long-term prognosis not decisions by knee-jerk bulletin is what is required
