mr president the council meeting will take place less than two weeks after the treaty of lisbon comes into force and we have as the minister said been through a long and difficult process to reach this point
but many of us feel that we have missed a critical opportunity
there is still a missing link a vital democratic element in the relationship between the eu and the people of europe and that is the sub-state or regional level of government
many constituents feel that europe is as distant as it ever was and we have to address this urgently
not all of us had a referendum and the opportunity to give our views on the future development of europe yet there are things happening across the eu that have a direct impact on our work in facing the challenges before us and all of those policy issues that have already been mentioned employment social rights economic regulation fighting terrorism peace and justice and i am proud to speak incidentally as chair of the campaign for nuclear disarmament in wales
we are weeks away from the copenhagen summit the biggest challenge of all
up to eighty of mitigation and adaptation policies will be implemented at the local and regional levels
and many regional governments like the government in wales have been leading the way in adopting radical policies to combat climate change
this is where any international agreements made will be delivered
so we must look beyond the member state level to the peoples of europe
on sunday thirteen december over one hundred and fifty municipalities in catalonia are holding referendums on independence from spain
how is the eu responding to this
will this be on the council agenda
i very much doubt it but it should be
europe is changing and i hope that the new president will recognise and respond to this
