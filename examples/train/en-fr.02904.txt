madam president i would like to share with you some extracts from the interim report of the uk chief inspector of nuclear installations we all need to adhere to the principal of continuous improvement
that means that no matter how high the standards of nuclear design and subsequent operation are the quest for improvement should never stop
the uk nuclear regulatory system is largely non-prescriptive
that means that the industry must demonstrate to the regulator that it fully understands the hazards associated with its operations and knows how to control them
so we expect the industry to take the prime responsibility for learning lessons rather than relying on the regulator to tell it what to do
conclusion number one reads in considering the direct causes of the fukushima accident we see no reason for curtailing the operation of nuclear power plants or other nuclear facilities in the uk
conclusion two reads in response to the fukushima accident the uk nuclear power industry has reacted responsibly and appropriately displaying leadership for safety and a strong safety culture in its response to date
conclusion four reads to date the consideration of the known circumstances of the fukushima accident has not revealed any gaps in scope or depth of the safety assessment principles for nuclear facilities in the uk
in conclusion let us remember the extraordinary nature of the earthquake and the strength of the tsunami that hit the fukushima installation and which has started all this process
