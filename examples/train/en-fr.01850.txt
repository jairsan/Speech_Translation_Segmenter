madam president in a time of economic challenge this parliament has made much of its credentials in encouraging entrepreneurship and competitiveness but at the same time we are setting about restricting the right to work of self-employed lorry drivers
i have to say that i reject as utterly bogus the claims in this house this morning that this is about health and safety
we are all concerned about health and safety and do not want to see any more accidents on our roads
i represent northern ireland
it is right on the edge of europe
the road transport industry is hugely important to the economy and the inclusion of self-employed lorry drivers will only have a negative impact on competitiveness
it is an industry that is highly regulated through tachograph rules and the financial implications of further red tape would be devastating
it would also be hugely damaging to those hoping to set up as independent drivers
