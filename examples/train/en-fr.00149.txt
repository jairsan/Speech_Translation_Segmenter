madam president i should like to say to the ombudsman that it has been a really interesting debate sniped at by hans-peter martin lauded as a god by another
i think it shows that he has probably just about got it right
ombudsman parliament does not always place you in a very comfortable position when you are called upon especially to rule on decisions that we take and the actions of this house
i see that i have excited hans-peter martin how wonderful but let me just tell you ombudsman that you always carry out your work in a constructive way and absolutely within your competences
probably the reason why we have seen an increase in your workload is because you have been so effective in promoting your work and your office and i congratulate you on that
it leaves me nothing more than to say that it is an excellent report
i look forward to contributions from other colleagues but also i enjoy working with you not the least in relation to access to documents but also as vice-chair of the committee on petitions
