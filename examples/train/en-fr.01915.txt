mr president this report and resolution that we have voted on today on new media and journalism was supposed to look at the ways the new media are changing journalism
instead it has in reality become a wish list for meps wishing to improve their column inches and who desire to manipulate how much the eu is reported on
proposals include european training programmes for journalists more money for parliament's information offices and yet more money for eu communication policy
i believe in freedom of speech
i also believe in independent credible journalism
forcing and funding journalists and public independent broadcasters to cover eu matters in order to promote the european ideal is blatant propaganda and this is why i voted against this report and resolution
in deference to a vanity exercise an opportunity has been missed to look at ways to encourage democratic engagement through social media
