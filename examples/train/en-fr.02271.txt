madam president i will be brief because i think that all one might have wished to say has been expressed very well
mr preda again thank you to you and your team for your courage and your work during the elections
i commend you
there are two quick points i want to make
of course i have kept in touch with ban ki-moon throughout
he and i spoke at the very beginning of this crisis and discussed how outrageous the situation was and we agreed to collaborate very fully
equally i have been ensuring that the eu representatives on the ground are cared for we have contingency plans in place for their safety as you would expect
i also want to answer the specific question that was raised about the sanctions
i am expecting the list to be ready within the next few days
we want to get on with this as quickly as possible and to keep the pressure on as much as possible
there is a real danger of violence and there is a real danger of ambiguity around what is happening
we need to be very firm and very clear and to work as collaboratively as possible with the international community to keep the pressure on as heavily as we possibly can and to do the things required to get a satisfactory resolution
i am extremely grateful for the support in this house for the work that we are doing
