mr president in this changing world it is vitally important that the common agricultural policy goes on changing so that it can be relevant to the challenges of the future and not live in the past
the reformed common agricultural policy is going to have a vitally important role to play in confronting issues like food security market volatility and climate change but i want to mention three other principles which to my mind are no less important
firstly we must recognise that the best way of achieving the goals of the common agricultural policy is to create a viable dynamic farming sector and i do not think we should lose sight of that aim
secondly if you are going to achieve that the common agricultural policy needs to be simpler fairer and more transparent at point of delivery
finally it needs to deliver value for money
all nations and all sectors are experiencing tough economic times at present and i caution this committee to be utterly realistic about its expectations from the european budget
to my mind that means we should ensure that funds are used effectively
the rapporteur has produced an excellent report
i congratulate him on his work and am happy to support
