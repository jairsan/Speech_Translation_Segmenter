mr president in the twenty-seven countries of the european union we have a proud tradition developed over the last decades of fighting together against discrimination and of making discrimination illegal and something to be discouraged
what this report does is to correct an anomaly
we have legislation on our statute book which rightly prohibits discrimination on grounds of race and gender in the workplace and elsewhere but discrimination on grounds of disability or age or sexual orientation is prohibited only in the workplace but not elsewhere not in consumer protection and not in other situations which citizens can find themselves in and being discriminated against
it is right that we correct that anomaly
the large majority today sends a powerful signal to the council and i look forward to adoption in the near future
