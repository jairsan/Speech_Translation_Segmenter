mr president first of all i would like to compliment both rapporteurs on their reports and to refer in particular to carmen fraga est√©vez's report which has proved to be non-controversial as all parties have agreed to the compromise
the report aims to ensure the long-term conservation and optimum utilisation of fisheries resources in the north-east atlantic area providing sustainable environmental and social benefits
i would like to take this opportunity to raise the ongoing dispute relating to mackerel as some of the stock is fished within the north-east atlantic area
it is important that this dispute is resolved as quickly as possible because over-fishing of the mackerel stock will have a devastating impact on future catches
it is vital that the stock is fished in a sustainable manner and all parties should sign up to this
i understand that recent talks in london were inconclusive but i note that they will resume next week
i wish these talks well and i hope that good sense will prevail
commissioner i understand that you will assess the situation after the talks on twenty-six october and i appreciate the firm stand you have decided to take
you must ensure that this jointly managed stock remains healthy in the future
finally we cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past in relation to blue whiting
we cannot decimate this healthy mackerel stock
