mr president whilst the commission is very keen on defending our human rights we british have known since the thirteenth century exactly where we have stood
i am afraid to say that the lisbon treaty is a pale shadow of our magna carta
the commission likes to see itself as a global actor in the area of human nights and seems to be keen to judge others and to offer help and advice
however it should take a critical look at itself
i find it deeply ironic that whilst the eu rightly supports the rights of the kashmiris who patiently await a referendum on the right to self-determination that they were promised by the united nations in nineteen forty-seven the commission actively seeks to take away competence from its own member states in the important areas of high policy via the lisbon treaty
in fact this brings me on to the subject of a referendum that was promised to the british electorate but which simply never happened
therefore my electorate awaits self-determination along with the kashmiris
