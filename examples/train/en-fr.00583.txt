i am not among the greatest defenders of the cap
i am generally in favour of continuing reform of the cap but i hope that we will not be in a situation of importing liquid or dried egg
also i believe that most of the ec's standards regarding placement on the market are based not just on what we have agreed here in europe but on the internationally agreed codex alimentarius standards and the un economic commission for europe standards
it is important that everybody follow certain standards and that we do not create the conditions which would seriously undermine this
tbt agreements oblige the wto and its members to ensure that technical regulations voluntary standards and conformity assessment producers do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade
