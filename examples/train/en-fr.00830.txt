mr president i cannot hide the fact that this report has been a serious disappointment to those of us who thought that a rapporteur who was also the president of the animal welfare intergroup might have reflected that concern for animals rather more diligently in his report
it is therefore essential that some crucial amendments are adopted when we vote on this
in particular the scope of authorisation must apply to all projects not just to severe and moderate ones
if we fail to ensure that it will mean that many procedures causing pain distress or suffering would no longer be subject to a centrally monitored ethical review and that in turn would effectively undermine the enforcement of many of the measures set out in the proposal as a whole
but if our amendments are passed it will mean that there will be renewed effort going into research and the alternatives to animal testing which is particularly critical in basic and medical research
current efforts are concentrated on regulatory testing which accounts for only ten of animal use
for the sake of both the animals and human health it is essential that more modern effective non-animal tests come into use as soon as possible
