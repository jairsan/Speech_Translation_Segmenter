mr president first of all i would like to thank you for your comments and the general support for the provisions included in this directive
we have before us an ambitious directive that if adopted will significantly improve animal welfare in the eu
i agree with ms sârbu that full and faithful implementation will be key for the directive to fulfil its potential
that challenge is just beginning
today we can be satisfied that a good compromise has been reached on a difficult but important file and that a big step forward can be made on improving the lives of animals still needed in scientific procedures
i will now give my reactions to some of the comments that were made this morning
regarding the comments made by ms evans it has to be realised that this directive provides further legal clarity to today's situation
in addition in basic and applied research for which no eu methods are prescribed article four is very clear in requiring the use of alternative methods wherever possible
therefore the requirement to use alternative methods is not weakened on the contrary it is further strengthened
as for the comments made by mr kastler and mr mikolášik about human embryonic stem cells this matter was not disregarded in the discussions
it was discussed at length during the negotiations and the solutions found reflect the fact that there is no consensus in the eu as to whether human embryonic stem cells should be used
the commission therefore believes this is best regulated at national level
the agreed text answers these concerns by leaving the decision on whether to allow their use to each individual member state
it must be added that in member states where there is no explicit legislation prohibiting the use of embryonic stem cells the use of such a testing method would only be obligatory under the revised directive if this testing method were recognised by eu legislation
no legislation of this kind exists at eu level and any such legislation would require member states to agree to its being passed
as for the ethical evaluation mentioned by ms gardini the concept of ethical evaluation and the committee carrying it out remain firmly in article thirty-eight
however the word ethical had to be removed during the council discussions
the full requirement remains
i hope that with your vote you will send a strong signal that the european parliament stands behind the outcome negotiated by the institutions under the skilful leadership of ms jeggle and the swedish presidency
today we have the chance to bring the eu to the forefront in combining a high level of animal welfare with quality science
let us live up to our slogan the eu caring for animals aiming for better science
