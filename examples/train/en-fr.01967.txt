mr president to conclude the transitional arrangements are there to help member states avoid labour market disturbances following the accession of new member states and not simply to delay application of the free movement of workers to those nationals until the end of the transitional period
as mrs parvanova has said the biggest asset we have is our citizens and we must keep pushing for free movement in order to be able to attain an effective single market in the labour sector
mr kalfin also mentioned health workers as an example of the movement of workers
i must say at this point that we are seeing health workers being poached from the new countries by countries that are maintaining these restrictions and this is sometimes to the detriment of the new member states
therefore i agree with mr kalfin that we should appeal to member states to lift restrictions as soon as possible
the commission will not only continue to monitor how member states apply these transitional arrangements but will also continue to promote specific activities to combat undeclared work in cooperation with the member states
more importantly it will continue to encourage member states to re-examine their decisions on restricting access to the labour market for bulgarian and romanian workers in the light of the situation of their labour markets
