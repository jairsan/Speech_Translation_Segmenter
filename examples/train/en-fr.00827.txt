madam president i will also support the compromise but i am not at all sure that we are doing the right thing because the issue at hand is not whether we kill seals or whether the seals are in danger of not surviving these issues have been cleared up
the issue is whether they are killed humanely or not
and of course in our daily existence we know there are hundreds of thousands of animals that we are happy to have killed either to eat them or to use their products in other ways
we are happy to have fish dying after hours of suffering on hooks and in nets and we do not complain about that
so why are we complaining about the seals
well because they are beautiful animals and because watching their blood being spilt on white ice is not very nice
so are we voting and are we deciding with our hearts rather than with our brains and our heads on this
i just wonder
