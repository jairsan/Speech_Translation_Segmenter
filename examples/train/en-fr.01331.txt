madam president unfortunately yemen long ago developed the characteristics of a terrorist incubator and not enough attention has been paid to this over the years
conflict lawlessness and corruption are deeply embedded
it is worth recalling by the way that the reason that british troops intervened in yemen in the early nineteenth century was to put an end to piracy in the gulf of aden and they were very successful for over a century
in more recent years of course yemen has both developed as a terrorist incubator where terrorist acts have taken place and exported terrorism to other countries
terrorist groups are adept at exploiting the possibilities provided by failed states
we need to help counter this
at the moment the uk is disproportionately providing assistance
i hope that the london conference will encourage other countries to do more including the european union and i agree other regional states
of course we cannot hope to snuff out terrorism wherever it breeds and that means we must improve the security of our own countries and have more effective controls on our own borders
i doubt that the eu is motivated properly on this so each of our own countries needs to put its house in order
