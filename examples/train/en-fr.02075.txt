mr president i would like to say to my colleague mrs muscardini that in the words of shakespeare you have done the state some service because for too long we have been like a fairy godmother to the world spreading our generosity far and wide and being treated like a fairy in return
we have seen that in copenhagen and we see it in the united nations but thankfully tonight we will begin to fight back and establish a level playing field for our consumers and for our manufacturers
it actually makes no sense whatsoever that goods can come into the european union from third countries without some indication of where they came from
i would like to see this going much further
my colleague mrs dodds said that she would like to see it extended to agriculture and this is at least a first step
we need to help our consumers to make choices to know that the choices they are making are correct ones that there is no counterfeiting and there is fair play for everybody
so well done to my colleague mrs muscardini
we are on the road at last
