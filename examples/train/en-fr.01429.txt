mr president as a representative of northern ireland i know only too well the terrible impact of terrorism on innocent civilians murder and mayhem inflicted while people were doing their saturday shopping in the shankhill road in belfast young and old blown up at an act of remembrance to the fallen of the world wars in enniskillen acts carried out in the name of irish republicanism
we talk here about the cooperation of the security forces
from the experience of northern ireland we can see that their contributions prevented many people from losing their lives of that i have no doubt
we need to support our security forces with the equipment they need to prevent terrorism
those today who have pitted safety and security against freedom of choice and data protection need to consider where they stand
believe me terrorism destroys lives and shatters communities
i have even heard in this chamber today that terrorism is hysteria
what utter nonsense believe me when a gunman is trying to take a life it is a cold and lethal reality something that my constituents know a lot about
