madam president this is on a point of order because i think people are talking and not listening
i heard what the commissioner said on the food import situation
i think you are missing the point and i think with respect our rapporteur is also missing the point
farmers in europe will be banned from using particular substances
their cousins outside the european union can use these products
we will not find residues in the food that comes in
we are talking about a competitive disadvantage for eu producers
perhaps at another point we could address the real world rather than this vague ether we are currently in
sorry for the anger
