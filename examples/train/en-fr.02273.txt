mr president twenty ten will be remembered as the year when the deep flaws in the euro project were exposed and the public in europe woke up to the sheer stupidity of their leaders
so here we have another summit another crisis confidence in the euro ebbing by the week
it is like watching a slow-motion car crash and now you want a permanent bail-out mechanism
you think that if you have a fund of say a billion euros all will be well
well it will not be well
the failure of the euro is nothing to do with speculation
it is nothing to do with the markets be they currency or bonds it is because the north and the south in europe cannot today or at any point be put together in a single monetary union
it will not work
and politically of course you have to change the treaty
the reason being that the four german professors will win at karlsruhe and prove that the bail-outs you have put in place already were in fact illegal under the treaties
well in many ways i welcome this treaty change because it will mean that there has to be a referendum in ireland
and you never know david cameron might even keep his promise and hold a referendum in the united kingdom
i am sure that as democrats you would all welcome a referendum on the eu in the united kingdom
we should also reflect at the end of twenty ten not just on the state of the union but on the state of belgium
for six months the belgian presidency-in-office have sat here telling us we must integrate more deeply
what a farce this is
you have not had a government in your own country since june
here we have a non-nation trying to abolish our nation
it truly is an absolute farce but nobody here dares to admit it because you are all in denial
belgium is a microcosm of the entire european union
belgium is about to fall to bits and the rest will follow
happy christmas everybody
