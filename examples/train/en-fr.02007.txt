mr president it is good to hear the uk independence party confirming that they do not care a jot about animal cruelty that they are happy to have the world treated like a giant chemistry set
thalidomide and ddt would be on everyone's breakfast table if they had their way
a concern has been raised here that we have seen in british newspapers about the effect of banning anti-coagulant rodenticides and the question of whether this will lead to rat infestations in cities and towns
we have worked with the commission we have raised the issues brought to our attention by professionals and working with the commission changes have been made
they are now in article five and i believe they have the support of the commission
that should deal with the major problem which has been expressed
but there is the issue that mrs girling has raised article forty-four about difenacoum
i would like the commission to explain whether it supports amendment two hundred and forty-three because it seems to me that it contradicts in some ways the changes being proposed to article five
