mr barroso the recent wikileaks storm has led to mixed feelings with some people saying transparency is good and others saying perhaps the leaks will damage international diplomacy
however i was particularly amused by the references to you in wikileaks where it mentioned your trip to russia and the fact that you were ignored and excluded and the russian view from upon high that you were nothing more than a glorified international civil servant
mr barroso remember we have discussed this before here
i have pointed out to you again and again that you have not been directly elected by the people and you therefore have no real legitimacy
is the fact that you are unelected the reason why you do not command more respect on the global stage and why increasingly the peoples of europe are holding you and the entire commission in contempt
