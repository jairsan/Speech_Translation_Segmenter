i take the opportunity to follow up on the first part of this question and to raise the issue about public contracts generally and the issue of restricted tenders which a lot of people would suggest represent or result in poor value for money
perhaps the commission might at some time perhaps not now address this issue particularly in the more straitened economic circumstances that many of our member states face and look again at the issue of contracts and tenders and specifically restricted tenders
