mr president canada is a close ally but the eu must be a critical friend where necessary
canada's record on climate change is poor and canada was obstructive during the copenhagen negotiations
of particular concern is the tar sands industry as mr arsenis mentioned
extracting oil from tar sands requires much more energy than oil produced from other sources as well as being very polluting for the local environment
given that the canadian government is currently trying hard to get the commission to weaken its approach to carbon measurement in the implementation of the fuel quality directive may i ask the high representative whether she will be raising the issue of tar sands in the summit discussions
