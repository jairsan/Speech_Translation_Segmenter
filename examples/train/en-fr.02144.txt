in two thousand and seven the commission set up a structured dialogue with sports stakeholders on the basis of the two thousand and seven white paper on sport
following calls from eu sports ministers and the european council in two thousand and eight the commission committed itself to further strengthening the dialogue and to giving international sports organisations a more prominent place in the dialogue with the european union
this has led to regular exchanges between the commission and the international olympic committee and international sports federations
in two thousand and eight the commission established the eu sport forum
this is considered to be at the heart of this structured dialogue gathering together once a year all key sports stakeholders at international european and national level including governing bodies as well as non-governmental sports organisations
the next forum will take place in february twenty eleven in budapest where the commission intends to present its communication on a new eu sports agenda to sports stakeholders
the commission has paid great attention to the need to ensure a balanced and inclusive representation of the sports movement when organising meetings and events
it is committed to this dialogue taking into account the specific organisation of sport the complexity of topics to be addressed and of course the diversity of sports actors
the reinforcement of this structured dialogue with the sports movement will be essential for the success of the eu agenda for sport which the commission intends to propose based on the lisbon treaty
within this strengthened dialogue member states parliament and the commission should all have their place
