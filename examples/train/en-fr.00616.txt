mr president during this economic crisis something very odd happened on the way to the forum as they used to say
the people of europe did not look to the european union to save them from the economic crisis
they looked to their member states and their national governments to save them from the economic crisis
the man who claims to have saved the world is about to come here in a couple of hours time but leaving that aside it is to the national governments in paris or london or washington or rome that the citizens of those countries who also happen to be told that they are citizens of europe look to save them not this larger entity called the eu
may i ask why that happened
may i ask those who bang on about the eu being this magnificent machine to ask themselves that question
i can give you the answer
the answer is that there is no demos there is no connection between the eu institutions and the people
the people still look to their national governments to save them
