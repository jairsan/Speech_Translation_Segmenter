madam president the great danger for egypt and the other north african countries is of course that the overthrow of their governments will not usher in western-style liberal democracy but rather islamic fundamentalist rule and a new dark age such as we saw in iran
nevertheless there is a certain satisfaction to be derived from the prospect of oppressed peoples overthrowing their undemocratic and unrepresentative governments
all governments even tyrannies ultimately derive their power from the consent of the people that they govern
and you can repress people for so long and so much but there is always the possibility that they will rebel
now there is a parallel here with britain where successive governments of all political colours have consistently betrayed our country and surrendered our rights of democratic self-determination to the european union
under magna carta the english have the right of lawful rebellion
i wonder just how far they will have to be pushed before they are driven out on the streets like the egyptians
