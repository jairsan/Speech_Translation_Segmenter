mr president this morning as you are aware we are discussing the cap post twenty thirteen and yet much of our discussion is being undermined by the reopening of negotiations with mercosur
where i ask is the consistency
a few weeks ago after it was announced that you were reopening negotiations with mercosur i had a short meeting with you
during that meeting you said that if there was to be an ambitious deal it was likely there would have to be concessions on agriculture
that is why i am extremely concerned
already we are talking about possible concessions on agriculture and i would like you to clarify this
in your response you spoke about forthcoming summits on climate change
are you doing any assessment on issues such as carbon leakage deforestation loss of biodiversity in the context of further imports of agricultural products from mercosur countries
i come from ireland and we export ninety of our beef
recent research has shown that brazilian emissions are between three and eight times higher than the irish equivalent
will any of this be taken into consideration in your impact assessments
