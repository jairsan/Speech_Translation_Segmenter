madam president i am increasingly concerned about the way local councils in my constituency in the north west of england are using car parking charges to top up their revenue
take the small town of congleton for example which is a local semi-rural community
the introduction of car parking charges will severely damage local industry and a fall-off in trade will result in a loss of revenue forcing already hard-pressed smes into bankruptcy and possible closure
people are blaming the british government some blame the unitary council and others point the finger at the town council but as always the dark hand of the european union lies in the background for they are all working towards the framework set out in the eu's european transport policy for twenty ten
you see this is the genius of the eu it is always one person removed
whether it is post office closures or fortnightly bin collections the finger always gets pointed elsewhere and the corruptive influence of brussels does not appear on the radar
