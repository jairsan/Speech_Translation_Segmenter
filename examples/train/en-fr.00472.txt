mr president we head now to copenhagen and my honourable friend's excellent report is a good if i dare say it road map or rail map on how we should get there
twenty per cent by twenty twenty was a start but only a start
the package of climate measures that we have taken perhaps could have been better but they were a start they were a step forward
now with the changes in administration in the united states we can no longer hide behind the united states refusal to cooperate
with the obama presidency we have the opportunity to stop exchanging words and start exchanging ideas
we hear that a meeting will take place on six march two thousand and nine
the following week we are back here and i hope we will have a statement from the council on the result of its meetings in washington
with the united states we can now move to that thirty target and beyond
we are moving on now to ecodesign realising here as elsewhere that it means tremendous new opportunities in innovation and jobs
we need to move on to shipping and to agricultural emissions
the commissioner has referred to the urgent need to talk to the low-income countries in the developing world
they will be devastated but they did not cause this problem
islands will sink beneath the waves malaria respiratory disease skin cancer and eyesight problems are already happening
devastation will come to agriculture
they must take action but they need our help
scientists of course can be wrong and so can politicians as we saw with mbeki and aids
i may be wrong about the possible flu pandemic
i may be wrong about the probable impact of global warming
however the majority of scientists may be right the majority of politicians may be right
i and we will be culpable on both issues if i and we fail to take action to ensure that neither happens
