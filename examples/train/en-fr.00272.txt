mr president when i became parliament's rapporteur i resolved to go beyond my brief and try and accelerate the development of carbon capture and storage technology
the committee on the environment public health and food safety adopted a twin-track approach one was to put in place a financial mechanism to support the construction of demonstration projects and the second was to introduce a regulatory means of preventing the construction of the dirtiest power plants by means of an emissions performance standard
both proposals were initially opposed by the commission and the council
one good argument against the introduction of emissions performance standards at this time is that ccs technology first needs to be tested and proven
i think parliament can be pleased that it has at least achieved one great step forward in putting in place a financial mechanism which will bring forward the demonstration projects
i remain convinced that we will eventually need an emissions performance standard
but i thank madame grossetÃªte and the shadow rapporteurs for the help they have given me in achieving the progress we have made
to the critics of carbon capture and storage technology i say this just get real just look at the world as it is the enormous quantities of coal being used and the fact that the international energy agency is predicting a seventy increase in coal use over the next twenty years
we need to develop this technology
i do not want it it is not my ideal but we need to develop something that can deal with emissions on this massive scale
ccs technology may provide us with a huge weapon to help us win the fight against global warming
we need to take it forward
we cannot afford for one second to ignore its potential
