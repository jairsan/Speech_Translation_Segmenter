i would like to thank the president-in-office
i do not mean to make him paranoid with my question
it was tabled after all last december
i am anti-smoking not anti-smokers
we all agree they need all the help they can get nicotine replacement therapies etc
but we must recognise the damage that passive smoking does to those who do not enjoy smoking so please do not feel personally under the spotlight here
could you guarantee me then that before the end of the czech presidency you will have ratified the framework convention yes or no
it would be extremely important if you could give me guarantees on that
after all cigarettes are the only legal product on our shop shelves that if used by consumers according to instructions kills one in two of the consumers
they are amazing really
