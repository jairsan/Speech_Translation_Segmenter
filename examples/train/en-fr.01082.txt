mr president the big problem for the member states is as mr bisky said earlier the crisis in jobs
youth unemployment is twenty-four in france twenty-five in italy and thirty-nine in spain
nevertheless we can be sure that the european council meeting will be saturated with a colossal triumphalism in the context of mass unemployment
this triumphalism is improper and distasteful and it will be there because the elite assume that they have got their lisbon treaty
all the moves so far towards your european superstate have taken place by stealth or manipulation and in the case of the lisbon treaty the manipulation has been so shameless and so blatant that the treaty lacks democratic legitimacy
from that there will be consequences
to quote they are ringing the bells now very soon they will be wringing their hands
