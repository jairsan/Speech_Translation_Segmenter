mr president the revision and reform of parliamentary procedures is now heading up the agenda and i am sure that this is a subject very much dear to your own personal heart
can i please underpin the comments already made by a few colleagues about the importance of intergroups
i am co-president of the intergroup on ageing and as you may be aware over fifty of voters this year for the very first time will be over fifty as opposed to under fifty
so ageing issues are not just something that are of interest to people in here but are of interest to people right outside amongst our constituents
i would plead with you mr president to use the qualities of clarity and fairness which are the hallmarks of your presidency to make sure that the work of intergroups can be facilitated and not hindered from here on
have we got your promise please
