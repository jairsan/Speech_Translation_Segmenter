mr president i will be very brief in order to make up for mr nicholson and ensure that we do not run late
the lisbon treaty will be in force if i calculate correctly seven days and five hours from now
i must say that the rush by the council to adopt a whole series of decisions is somewhat embarrassing in the light of this
what i also find embarrassing is that there is an empty seat here where i would have hoped to see the council so that we could actually have an exchange of views
i basically endorse the proposals made by the previous speaker
of course we support the development of europol
we want a strong europol
we want a europol that is able to operate and fight against crime but we also want a europol that is subject to democratic scrutiny
i therefore endorse the proposal made by the previous speaker to ask the council to withdraw the proposals on europol and present a new proposal within a maximum of six months and preferably earlier under the lisbon treaty
finally when it comes to the specific subject that i am rapporteur for which is europol and the transfer of personal data and confidential documents to third parties i would like to hear from the council which is absent on how it feels about the analysis made by the european parliament's legal service to the effect that the legal basis chosen for this particular proposal is the wrong one
i do not know who is going to answer for the council but maybe it can come back on this and send somebody who can provide us with a reply
