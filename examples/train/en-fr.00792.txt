does the czech presidency not agree that the problem in the case of the lisbon treaty is not so much a lack of information about it since the information is there and is available but the considerable amount of misinformation wilfully put about by the opponents of the treaty
given that the treaty is not being signed by the european institutions but was negotiated by the member states does it not also agree that the national governments must do much more to counter the myths and misinformation that mr mitchell referred to and get their act together in this vital debate for the future of europe
