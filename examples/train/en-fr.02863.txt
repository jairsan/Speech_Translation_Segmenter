madam president commissioner this debate is an evaluation of the situation regarding the new hungarian constitution not the common law of the united kingdom which has protected our citizens for nearly nine hundred years
it is the commission which is charged with assessing and acting on such issues as are laid out in the treaties and as requested by this parliament only a few months ago
this house was hoping to ask the commission what its conclusions are and how it intends to proceed and we still look forward to your guidance but it seems we have to wait a little bit longer
this is a union of different cultures and differing priorities
however we all share values of freedom fairness and equality for every person and every member state
what we should not tolerate is intolerance itself
what we ask now is for you commissioner to give this house as soon as possible a definitive answer as to whether the hungarian constitution is in line with european legislation and fundamental rights
if it is not what next
if it is commissioner we need to know that too as soon as we can
