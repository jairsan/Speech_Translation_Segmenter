mr president there is a high risk of jobless recovery or jobless growth and europe cannot afford that to happen
firstly we must focus our employment strategy on the union's comparative advantages which are education research and green technology
secondly we must avoid a trade-off between innovation and job creation such a trade-off can be avoided if innovation is inclusive
thirdly we must strike a sustainable balance between support for existing jobs and the creation of new ones
investing in a highly-skilled labour force will go hand in hand with innovation
of course there will be jobs that are not sufficiently rewarded by the markets and we must have policy instruments to cope with this
fourthly there is a need to activate both labour demand and supply policy measures
there are plenty of employment policy instruments available but they must be put together in a good and comprehensive policy framework
fifthly we must successfully orchestrate efforts and responsibilities and policy instruments between all levels of governance european national regional and local
last but not least the internal market must provide for full mobility of the labour force particularly in terms of career and lifelong learning and it must do so horizontally geography-wise
