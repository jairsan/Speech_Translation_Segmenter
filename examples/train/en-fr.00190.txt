again i am pleased to hear what the commissioner has to say but i share the concerns of the last speaker
i am concerned about how the message is going to be conveyed out there and i agree about the electronic media
there is a real danger that brochures and books will remain in offices unread
i have seen this happen so many times
i suppose the question i want to ask is how do you intend to get the message out there to those who are interested
are you going to try to target interested groups or is it simply a blanket approach
