mr president i fully agree with the comments of mr czarnecki
the attack last july on the iraqi pmoi camp at ashraf in iraq can only be described as savage and barbaric
eleven people killed and a lot more could have been killed numerous people brutally injured you have to see the video to realise the barbarity which actually occurred
the army and the military indulged themselves in the most sadistic form of brutality
as a result thirty-six people were arrested they had no option but to go on hunger strike
they were released two weeks ago because of international pressure and international pressure after seventy-two days on hunger strike that is what brought people to heel in relation to the malaki government
so these people are refugees they are entitled to go to bed at night and get up in the morning safe
we need as mr czarnecki said two things first of all we need a permanent un presence there to replace the united states and secondly an absolute guarantee of no displacement
