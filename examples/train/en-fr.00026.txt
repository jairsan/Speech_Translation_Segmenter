mr president i am both looking forward to and dreading the cross-border health directive
i am looking forward to it because i know so many people who are more disabled and so many people who have died as a result of a long wait for treatment in irish public hospitals
so the thought that my constituents will be able to get their medical records and travel without the current prior authorisation obstacle presented by the e one hundred and twelve scheme to go and get treatment promptly is wonderful
i will certainly be advising those of my constituents who can travel to do so
however i am also aware that this will further exacerbate the problems in the irish health system and for those who cannot travel and who must rely on that health system i am in dread
