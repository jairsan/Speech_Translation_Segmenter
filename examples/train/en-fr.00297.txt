madam president i welcome the statement by the president this evening on gaza and indeed the decision of parliament to have a resolution on the issue to urge an immediate unilateral ceasefire by all sides in the gaza conflict
with over nine hundred now dead the futility of politics-by-war is painfully evident
you must insist that israel stop the killing
gaza is the largest prison in the world with one point five million prisoners it is now also a slaughterhouse unfortunately with men women an children dying simply because they are palestinian
what possible crimes could the palestinian children who are dying in this conflict be guilty of
what possible excuses have we europeans to continue to do business with israel while it callously continues to slaughter innocent people
the european council must stop making excuses stop the bickering and unite in concerted action which will bring this slaughter to an end
there can be no question of upgrading europe's relations with israel so long as it fails to engage in constructive dialogue with all the representatives of the palestinian people
