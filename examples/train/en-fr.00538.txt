commissioner there is no greater hate crime than murder and this week in my constituency of northern ireland we had three hate murders of members of the security forces by irish republican terrorists
and yet within hours there were a number of sites across the internet glorifying those hideous murders and praising those who had carried them out
so as well as looking at racism and xenophobia is the commission focused on how it deals with the abuse of the internet by terrorist parasites
