mr president i must say that it is quite enthusing to see that there are so many meps who treat this place with the contempt i do
out of the seven hundred and thirty-six there are fewer than thirty of them here which is under five percent and it is half four on a tuesday afternoon
as usual eu rules and regulations are running out of control
but that is nothing compared to the rats and mice that will run out of control when the eu takes away common rat poison from ordinary householders
this is what amendment two hundred and forty-three of this report will do
this daft piece of legislation will ensure that only professionals will be allowed to put down rat poison which is freely available in shops
so if rats are in your front garden spreading their diseases and chewing everything up the ordinary uk householder will be forced to wait for the council rat catcher or have to pay for rentokil
we are already told that you are never further than twenty yards away from a rat in a city centre in the uk
this piece of crazy legislation will only make things worse
to put this into perspective this is a piece of bureaucracy for a rat poison that has been safely used by ordinary folk for the past thirty years not only in the uk but across europe and in the usa
i will finish by asking a question
why are you doing this
do you want more vermin
do you want more disease
or is it just about control and your obsession with trying to govern every single aspect of our lives
