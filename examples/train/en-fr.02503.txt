mr president let me thank you very much for this encouraging and constructive debate
the draft european parliament resolution with its balanced message is of vital support for the work undertaken by the commission
it provides much useful guidance for further work by croatia and i particularly welcome the many references to fairness quality and credibility made during today's debate
i also fully agree with those statements made today underlining that this whole process and the efforts required are for the benefit of croatian citizens
those benefits will have to be clearly communicated in the months to come
the constructive and steadfast support provided by parliament for croatia's accession process is an important signal
it is important not only for croatia itself but for all the candidate countries and potential candidates
indeed your support will encourage them to keep up the intensity of their efforts on the path towards the european union and closing negotiations successfully
