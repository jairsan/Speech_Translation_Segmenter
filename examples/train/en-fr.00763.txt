those in poland who are saying what the honourable member has been referring to are absolutely wrong
it is not correct and i can prove it with facts and figures
and before i answer your reference to the german shipyards you were only mentioning the old ones i would like to underline that the shipbuilding industry in other countries not only in germany but also in for example denmark the uk the netherlands or spain where the public pocket was not so generous was considerably downsized or even closed
we know a couple of examples where shipyards were closed
and if we speak about equal treatment we need to bear this in mind as well and not only talk about emotion and i am not blaming someone for having emotions i can imagine it is a very difficult situation but still it gives the wrong impression to say that there has not been equal treatment
in any event i can assure you mr president that the commission applied its rule in the same way to the german and to the polish shipyards and all the other ones that could be cited here
the same criteria are applied when assessing the state aid viability being the most prominent of them and the german shipyards let me take that example were successfully restructured and turned into a viable business while the commission considers that the restructuring plans presented by the polish authorities will not ensure long-term viability
finally mr president a parallel should also be made with cases where the commission has not authorised state aid and has even ordered recovery of illegal state aid in other member states
