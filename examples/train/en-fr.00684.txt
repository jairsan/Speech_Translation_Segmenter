mr president i know the commissioner is aware that tomorrow four zero consumers will go to the high court in the uk to seek compensation for severe allergic reactions hospitalisation and death as the result of the use of a chemical in sofas and household goods which has now been banned in the eu
france sweden and poland have reported similar cases and injuries
across europe there are potentially many thousands of consumers who have suffered severe injuries as a result of this toxic chemical
i believe that citizens support european intervention when it is seen to give real help to consumers to tackle real problems
real help in such cases means giving them the right to take action collectively wherever they buy goods and services
so our committee launched an online consultation on the commission proposal for consumer rights
we received many responses many of which from businesses and consumers highlighted the need for effective access to cross-border remedies and redress
there are i believe enough cases like the toxic sofa case with enough compelling evidence to prove that a range of options for collective redress is needed not only to improve access to justice but equally to deter illegal or unfair business practices
of course in our committee we want consumers to have access to cheap affordable means such as adr but i believe today's debate is first and foremost about identifying practical ways to give real help to our consumers and citizens to ensure they get a fair deal real redress and real remedies
