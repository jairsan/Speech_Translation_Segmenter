mr president the first part of amendment twenty-four acknowledges that social dumping was a contributory factor in the irish no to lisbon
i agree with that and also with the phrase that asks the council to take action to ensure equal pay for equal work
the amendment calls for all member states to respect the result of the referendum in ireland
that goes without saying apart from which this is a legal imperative on all member states anyway
however juxtaposed with all of that is a demand that we must embark on a profound revision of the existing treaties in order to open the road towards a social europe
talk about using a sledgehammer to crack a nut a profound revision of the existing treaties <unk> like tearing up the rule book to me
we already have very positive legislation on anti-discrimination and we are currently improving that legislation
we have reached a common position on the temporary agency workers directive
this will underpin the rights of workers and shows that the social heart of europe is still beating
amendment sixteen calls on member states to challenge the judgments of the european court of justice
that is not the way to do business
we do need to examine the posting of workers directive and ensure its correct transposition in all member states and if it needs to be changed then we must do so but a profound revision of the treaties is not necessary
