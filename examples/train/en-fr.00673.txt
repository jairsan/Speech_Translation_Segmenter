mr president i also supported the auken report
i supported it because many of my constituents in the north-east of england are among the petitioners who petitioned parliament about this disgraceful and flagrant abuse of property rights by the spanish government and local authorities
indeed they were recently the subject of a tv documentary by itv north east where some of these heart-rending cases were brought to life and were examined for the public of the north-east to see
i hope even now at this late stage that the spanish government and spanish meps will right some of the wrongs that have been done and will give some restitution to some of these people who have been unlawfully denied their property and recognise that actually what has gone on here is a scandal
it is a corrupt scandal
many of the deals involving property developers and spanish local government are frankly the result of corruption
we serve nobody by failing to recognise that essential point
the spanish government needs to act
i am frankly appalled at some of the abuses that have gone on in this chamber by spanish meps seeking to cover up these practices
