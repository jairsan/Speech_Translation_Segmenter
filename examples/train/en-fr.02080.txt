mr president better economic governance is required with earlier warnings and earlier actions
traditional debt and deficit targets have been breached by many countries but would not have warned us about the crisis pending in spain or ireland
other measures are needed too
economics however is not an exact science and it is not just about numbers
soviet history reminds us that central counting of tractor production does not in itself bring a strong economy and centralised taxes or a centralised treasury are not a utopian solution either
there are many questions about what actions to take now
threatening to fine a nearly bankrupt nation feels like an empty threat and promises of continual eurozone bailouts will always bring moral hazard
i am aware that people are concerned about franco-german deals but perhaps they have a point
if the market lends the money then maybe the market should take the loss not the taxpayer
