mr president i am pleased with the outcome of the vote here today because back in two thousand and six the employment and social affairs committee adopted a report on protecting european healthcare workers from blood-borne infections due to needle-stick and sharp injuries
of course we had the framework agreement last july between the social partners and today we have this resolution
this resolution will be warmly welcomed by healthcare workers across the eu because needle-stick injuries and sharp injuries represent one of the most common and serious risks for health workers
indeed it is estimated that there are about one million such injuries each year
it is now crucial that the measures defined in the proposed directive be urgently implemented and adopted first and then implemented
healthcare workers have waited too long already it is not reasonable that they should be asked to wait any longer
their job is difficult enough and stressful enough as it is and anything we can do to improve the situation will i know be very welcome
