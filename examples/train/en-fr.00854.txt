the negotiations on a free trade agreement with korea are the most advanced of the eu's ongoing trade negotiations
after two years of negotiations we now have a comprehensive agreement within reach with the eu's fourth-largest trading partner outside europe
the free trade agreement with korea would create new market access in many areas of interest to eu exporters
by way of illustration the agreement would swiftly eliminate eur one point six billion of customs duties to the benefit of eu exporters it would offer solid disciplines on non-tariff barriers in priority sectors such as the automotive pharmaceutical or consumer electrics sectors it would provide significant new market access in services of special interest to eu service providers it would offer the most ambitious package yet on intellectual property rights government procurement sustainable development and other rules issues and it would foresee novel ways of involving civil society in the monitoring of how the free trade agreement is implemented and protect our sensitivities with appropriate arrangements
the free trade agreement would also present a useful point of reference for other negotiations
moreover concluding that agreement now would demonstrate the commitment of both sides to open markets as one response to the current economic environment
at the end of the eighth round of negotiations in march two thousand and nine both sides made important technical progress at their level but a certain number of difficult issues remained unresolved
eu trade commissioner ashton and korean trade minister kim subsequently met in london on two april two thousand and nine
despite intensive discussions it was not possible to bridge gaps on the remaining issues such as duty drawback and rules of origin
the commission is currently consulting on the best way forward
