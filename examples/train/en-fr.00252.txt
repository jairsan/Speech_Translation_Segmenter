mr president i welcome the outcome of the trialogue negotiations and i believe that the text we will be voting on is a balanced and positive outcome for all
toy safety is of utmost importance now and at all times of the year for our children's health and safety is at stake
i applaud the stringency of the new measures in the current proposal such as the ban on cmr and allergenic fragrances
i also welcome the balanced nature of the proposal
there are over two zero toy manufacturers in the eu
the vast majority are extremely careful that a product they put on the market is safe
they should not have to suffer because of the low standards adopted by a small minority or the low standards applied by some importers and distributors
what recent scare stories have taught us is not to overreact and ban some toys altogether but rather to ensure that we step up our enforcement of rules already in place
i believe this text represents such a balance and therefore i would like to commend my colleague ms thyssen and all who have worked to make this a successful directive
