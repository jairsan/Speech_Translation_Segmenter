the issue of employment as you know is dependent on the overall economic situation
let us be completely clear about it
we cannot restore the levels of employment that we had before the crisis before we come back to more growth in europe
that is why we are concentrating our efforts on the new sources of growth and in fact trying to restore this growth that is critically important for the european union
that is our priority now
that said there were some measures that were taken specifically for employment
we have some proposals in our eu twenty twenty strategy for new skills for new jobs for programmes for youth but the basic thing is to restore the conditions for growth including confidence in our economy
when it comes to the greek situation as you know a lot has to do with the confidence also in the future of the greek economy
that is why it is so much dependent on the correction of some fiscal imbalances
