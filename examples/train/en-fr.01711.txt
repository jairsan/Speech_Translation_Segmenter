mr president i think it is appalling that a country with such massive oil reserves as nigeria should be involved in such mass atrocities but at the same time taking our cue from the vice president of the united states the solution has to be in dialogue dialogue dialogue allied with education education education so that peace can be brought to the country
i appreciated joe biden referring to the line by the irish poet william butler yeats a terrible beauty is born
we hope that terrible beauty may be turned into a wonderful beauty in nigeria where peace and prosperity will prevail
the european union has an important role to play in that and indeed in the discussion today and in the vote we have set out a marker
i appreciate that very much
