madam president the african union has proved sometimes to be a disappointment in confronting africa's many challenges
the au is all too often silent in the face of autocracy corruption electoral fraud and illegal coups d Ã©tat
if the eu and africa want to deepen and intensify their strategic cooperation in the future we cannot shy away from expressing our expectations of africa in a firm and frank manner
that means in reality that the african union must become a more responsible and responsive organisation with genuine moral and political authority
when africa needs help to tackle humanitarian crises we of course should continue to provide the necessary financial and human resources
in particular the eu needs to ensure that its commitment to the millennium development goals remains as robust as ever
the eu should also reflect on the damage done to african economies by its trade policies and its sometimes somewhat absurd farm subsidy regime
but ultimately only africans can solve africa's problems
we need to grasp this reality and make it central to our approach to this strategic continent and our relationship with it
