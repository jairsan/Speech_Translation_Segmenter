madam president we talk sometimes about grand designs and great plans and ambition
i was touched recently by the words of the canadian finance minister who spoke about being boring unexciting and prudent
i suggest that maybe we look carefully at what he had to say because he said that good regulation begins at home and before we start looking at the world we need to look at ourselves although i am inclined to the view that excessive regulation is as bad as none whatsoever
therefore we need to be very balanced in this
but whatever we do there are people now in business on farms and in households who cannot get small amounts of credit to keep themselves going
i was on a farm in ireland recently and they could not renew their eur twenty-five zero overdraft
this is a really serious problem and we need to address it
on the work programme we will have the budget review the implementation of the health check and review of fisheries
it will be a busy year and i wish you luck
