mr president i welcome the debate tomorrow on the air crisis because we need to remember that this has an impact not just on this parliament but on individuals and businesses across europe
this is at a time when europe or most of europe is recovering from a deep recession
the uk like many other countries not all is recovering from that recession and that is due to the government intervening when the market failed and not standing on the sidelines as some would have us do
there are many economic figures coming out in the uk in the next few weeks and i believe many of them will be positive
that is because the government has intervened
i think it is important for eu institutions also to intervene in difficult economic times
all the institutions of the eu should in the future make sure our budgets are aimed at helping individuals and businesses come through difficult economic times and to plan for the recovery
