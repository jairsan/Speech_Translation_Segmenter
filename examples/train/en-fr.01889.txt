mr president the future of the common agricultural policy will see increased focus on connecting it with climate change policy
in my constituency of wales the existing schemes and pillar two will be replaced by the glastir scheme that focuses on climate change objectives and carbon sequestration
farmers will be paid per hectare for water conservation reforestation and so forth
while reforming the cap post twenty thirteen it is important not to sacrifice pillar one for the sake of promoting new pillar two objectives
the single farm payment is vital for many farmers reliant on subsidies that could be stripped at the drop of a hat
if welsh farmers are unhappy about glastir arrangements will they be offered sensible alternatives or will they be penalised in any way for not adopting the scheme
choice without an alternative is no choice at all
wales has a strong history of agriculture and many communities depend heavily upon farming
current reforms of agricultural policy based solely upon climate change ideology could jeopardise the welsh farming tradition and wales's economic future
