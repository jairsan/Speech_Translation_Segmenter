madam president this report demolishes the lies of the british political class about the afghan war
i do not know the names of any of the innocent afghan victims of this wicked war but i do know that it has nothing to do with british interests
and i know the names of the eighteen brave young men from my constituency who paid with their lives for this madness in the last year alone
corporal simon hornby liverpool warrant officer david markland lancashire kingsman sean dawson stalybridge corporal harvey holmes hyde corporal terry webster chester lance corporal andrew breeze manchester marine steven birdsall warrington marine paul warren preston sergeant steven darbyshire wigan private alex isaac wirral private douglas halliday wallasey colour sergeant martyn horton runcorn private thomas sephton warrington sergeant david monkhouse cumbria sapper darren foster carlisle lance corporal jordan bancroft burnley kingsman darren deady bolton guardsman christopher davies st helens
what a criminal waste of brave young lives it is of course no business of the european union what wars britain should or should not fight
that is for the british people and our elected representatives in our house of parliament in westminster to decide just as it will be for us to decide one happy day to put messrs blair brown and cameron on trial for war crimes because afghanistan just like iraq is a criminal war
