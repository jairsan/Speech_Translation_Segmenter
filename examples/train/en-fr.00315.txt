mr president first of all the commission would like to thank the rapporteur ms grabowska as well as the committee on constitutional affairs for their excellent report
we agree that civil society plays an important role in european integration
it is one of the key tools for communication between european institutions eu society and eu citizens
it helps citizens to exercise their right to participate in the democratic life of the union
the commission has a long and healthy tradition of interaction with civil society organisations
this cooperation between the commission and civil society has grown covering a wide variety of issues from policy dialogue to project management both within the eu and in our partner countries
the treaty of lisbon would put our existing practices on a more formal footing and provide a fresh impetus to further enhance them
it would also open the door to another option for civil society to operationalise its views through the citizens initiative
involving interested parties in an active dialogue requires the provision of appropriate instruments for civil society to express its opinions and be heard
the eu institutions also need equally appropriate instruments to ensure that what we hear from civil society and citizens is properly picked up and put into the system
the commission welcomes the fact that the current report supports many of the ideas the commission is already putting into effect
through its mandate the current commission has taken a series of initiatives to involve civil society organisations and individual citizens in a public debate on eu issues
one of the more innovative examples of these efforts has been the citizens consultations experimenting with deliberative polling and face-to-face consultations
to understand people's needs and expectations over the past thirty-five years the eurobarometer has been developed into a very valuable tool for monitoring public opinion in europe
neither the commission nor parliament can however single-handedly organise a europe-wide public debate
this will only be possible if eu institutions and member states work together
that is the purpose of the political declaration on communicating europe in partnership <unk> by parliament the council and the commission on twenty-two october two thousand and eight
in this context the commission and parliament are already coordinating efforts with the member states via the management partnerships which include regional and local campaigns on specific issues linking up with action by local authorities and ngos
eleven new management partnerships in two thousand and nine will make this approach even more effective
the commission shares the view that fruitful dialogue depends on the active participation of all sides the eu institutions the member states and civil society
the commission hopes that the lisbon treaty will come into force and stands ready to take the necessary action to put its provisions into practice and to continue developing civil dialogue
