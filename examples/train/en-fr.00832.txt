mr president the legal vacuum created by the relevant ruling of the european court of justice necessitated the amendment of the directive under debate
it is incredible that a legal-basis error has caused a delay in the implementation of such an important directive and has without doubt been detrimental to our marine environment
lessons can and must be learned by all concerned in order to avoid such occurrences in the future
the main issue at this point in time is to speedily amend the proposed directive and get it on the road to implementation as soon as possible
only then can we envisage the widespread problem of the increase in the incidence and scale of illegal operational discharges of ship-source polluting substances being brought under control and only then will our task of fighting to keep our seas clean have real hope of success
in conclusion i wish to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work he has done on this report
