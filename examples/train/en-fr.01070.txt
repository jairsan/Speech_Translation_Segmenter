madam president the evidence is not that rising levels of co lead to temperature rises but that the causal connection is the other way round but of course we must not let facts get in the way of a good story

why then does the british labour party support aggressive and illegal wars that not only kill british soldiers iraqis afghans and in the future iranians but also produce vast increases in global emissions
