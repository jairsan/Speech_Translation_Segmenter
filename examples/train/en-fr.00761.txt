as i said when we talk about the real economy and the countries of eastern europe the financial possibilities which we have in our hands are truly limited
that is why we try to leverage as much of the money as we can from other financial institutions
that is why i mentioned that the money which actually amounts to eur seventy-one million has also triggered the financing of large infrastructure projects which are more than eur two point five billion
so the honest answer would be i think that all of us there are in deep trouble and that certainly one has to keep a close eye on what is happening in this region because we are highly interconnected with them and many european countries have deep trade relations with this region
concerning the possibility of macro-financial assistance there are many countries among the countries which have the potential to become member states which are candidates or potential candidates which have requested this
it is true that serbia requested it
it is highly likely that montenegro will also request it
from the countries of the southern region practically all but russia and azerbaijan have requested it
the potential for macro-financial assistance is to be honest rather limited and the list of countries asking for this support is quite long
i think that the major instrument that is why this discussion was very much one of topics of the g twenty summit should be channelled via imf support
we are very much in favour of this kind of activity and strengthened role or capitalisation of the imf in this direction because this is certainly a global problem
i could also mention that this macro-financial assistance if it is given to any of these states should also go through the consultation process via the european parliament
