mr president the appalling iranian theocratic dictatorship is already guilty of many crimes against its own people from hanging baha is to hanging homosexuals and now apparently hanging fifty innocent protestors
so we should hardly be surprised by the mere stealing of an election through wholesale electoral fraud
i believe this crack in the regime and the courage of its protesting youth whom i salute will eventually bring the whole rotten government down
mr howitt recently in another meeting suggested that we should have sent eu electoral observers from this house to confirm whether fraud had actually taken place
no we must never legitimise any sham election which restricts candidates on the basis of their religious purity and conducts its count behind closed doors
