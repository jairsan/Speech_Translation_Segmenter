madam president the announcement of the democratic opening last year gave hope of a genuine breakthrough in securing respect for kurdish linguistic cultural and human rights in turkey and closing the door on the years of terrorism and violence
yet tonight parliament joins council and commission in expressing our deep concern that what is closed instead with december's constitutional court decision is the political party which commands the majority of the vote in the country's kurdish majority areas and is what the country's human rights association calls the natural negotiator on behalf of the kurdish people
two years ago i personally attended as an observer the party's congress with some twenty zero people and saw and heard for myself their legitimacy in the eyes of their own supporters
i acknowledge that the closure of political parties was opposed by the turkish prime minister in his statement in the wake of the decision and today's turkish press reports the governing party's announced intention to prevent further unwarranted closures by bringing the constitution into line with article eleven of the european convention on human rights
these promises must be realised
but it is difficult for any of us to reconcile turkey's call for guerrillas to come down from the mountains with the fact that other members of the same community who have chosen the path of democracy are then shown lined up in handcuffs and marched into jail
between seven hundred and one zero of the party's members are reported to be imprisoned many for simply speaking their own language in public
in this european parliament we should particularly regret the jailing of nine of the party's elected mayors and the banning of two of its mps
in our parliament as in theirs the reason that we have parliamentary immunity is so that we as representatives of the people can speak out without fear
the fear that we have to combat for those of us intent on seeing turkey join the european union is the misplaced fear amongst some of the majority population that in a multi-ethnic country what we call minority rights are a threat to the unity of the state
in modern europe quite simply they are not
so finally a party whose turkish name translates as the democratic society party is gone but its aim of a democratic society in a modern turkey must not be lost
