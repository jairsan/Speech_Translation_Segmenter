madam president i think when we start from first principles we can all agree that nuclear weapons are bad
i think we all agree that war is a bad thing that is motherhood and apple pie
as the great philosopher edwin starr once said war huh what is it good for
absolutely nothing
but when we look at this we have to ask the question should the eu really replace the two nuclear member states in the whole process of non-proliferation given the lack of expertise that exists outside those member states
is it not premature to suggest that the uk should dismantle fissile material production when there is so much of this material that can get into the hands of terrorists and other rogue member states
this is nothing but a power grab and will actually do much less in the battle against nuclear proliferation and we should forget about power grabbing and actually tackle the problem itself
