mr president first it was cucumbers yesterday it was bean sprouts
today it is not bean sprouts
the truth is that the experts just do not know but each time such allegations are made they destroy livelihoods in countries economies
what we do know is that there is something very strange about this outbreak
there is an unnatural combination of strains and dna in the virus
it is affecting unusual groups of people in a way not normally associated with e coli outbreaks
it has already struck far more people and in far more places than a normal outbreak and unlike in normal outbreaks it has not been rapidly traced to one or two food suppliers
given all these inexplicable factors and the fact that various countries including britain the usa iraq and israel have in the past been reported as experimenting with genetically manipulated e coli as a biological weapon should there not be an urgent inquiry into the possibility that this outbreak is in fact an instance of and perhaps a test run for biological terrorism
