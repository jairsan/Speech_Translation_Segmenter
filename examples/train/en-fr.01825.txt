it is very clear that in the area of social policy the member states are responsible for organising their own social protection systems including the design financing and quality control of services provided in long-term care institutions
we cannot intervene or force a government to change its policy
we can only take general measures to push a government into caring for its population
one of the things we can of course do with the social fund is to train the staff and help have better care for those people but the basis decision on whether or not to have a foster house lies with the national governments
