mr president the row over the roma in france is of course caused directly by failing european union policies
it was a huge mistake to allow bulgaria and romania to join the european union whilst there were millions of roma in those countries being heavily discriminated against
it is no wonder that now they are part of the union they are seeking to move elsewhere
that goes for everything does it not
every single one of the policies fails and leads to a problem whether it is this or whether it is the euro and all the way through we see a fanatical political ambition to create a united states of europe regardless of the consequences
at no time has any of this been endorsed by the voting public
that mr barroso is the true state of the union
