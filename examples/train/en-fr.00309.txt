madam president i have to say i have grave concerns about this proposal that is before us here tonight and the effects it will have on the future of our agricultural industry
i want to put on record that i support the amendments put forward by mr sturdy which i have signed and which i am happy to support
i think they will at least help give the industry some support in the future
yes we do need and we do require legislation but it must be good legislation
we do not need to damage production in the process
we need a strong impact assessment to know what effects this will have and this is what is required and what is needed and this we do not have at present
we must have more facts and not fiction and we certainly should dwell on the facts
there is no point in europe legislating itself out of business because we cannot control what is imported in
this is where the commission have total double standards on what they impose within the european union and what they allow into the european union for all that will happen is that people will go outside
