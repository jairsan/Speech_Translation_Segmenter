madam president there are a number of problems with this constitution but i want to focus on one key issue which is that the proposed constitution does not give any protection from discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation
the only type of marriage that would be recognised would be one between a man and a woman
we have had a long fight across europe for lgbt rights and we cannot allow hungary to take this retrograde step
gay rights are protected by the eu charter of fundamental rights
not only that but married couples of the same sex should be able to move freely around europe and have their partnership legally recognised wherever they are
yes it is for hungary to decide the hungarian constitution
however each member state has the responsibility to respect the european community that they are part of
the protection of lgbt people is fundamental to the european union and hungary cannot disregard that
