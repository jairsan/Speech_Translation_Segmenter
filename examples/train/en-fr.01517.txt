mr president i want to thank the commissioner very much both on behalf of our group but also as the chairman of the committee on the internal market and consumer protection for making a very timely appearance before us this evening and also for having responded so quickly to the oral question from my committee on three december which set out a number of areas which he has answered very comprehensively
i think that we have some time available now as the commission is putting its ideas together in which my committee and i am sure the committee on transport whose representatives are here as well will want to reflect together about many of the issues that you have raised and how this is going to move forward
i think that given the nature and change of the whole of the travel and holiday business and many of the issues raised by colleagues tonight the new directive needs to be clearly future-proofed but that means it does not need to be too rigid in terms of trying to anticipate consumer needs
however one thing i do think the commission needs to think about is that there are other aspects that online consumers need to consider when they are shopping for travel issues about the safety of the hotel if they have young children a safe swimming pool for example or the fire safety of the hotel where my committee has done extensive work before
we need some proper indicators and markers there which may be done by voluntary agreement but i do think that this needs to be a wide-ranging and ambitious proposal
i get a sense from this that this is what you would like to do and i think my committee would give you full support in coming up with such a proposal
