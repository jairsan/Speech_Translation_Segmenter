mr president last night i helped to organise a hearing of experts from the region who told us that in bahrain the deaths so far at the hands of the security forces have been at least twenty-three in syria one hundred and thirty-two and in yemen at least sixty-three
it may be asked what can the eu do
well our resolution which will be adopted tomorrow makes some suggestions
however i have to say that in previous months the european parliament has passed resolutions on tunisia egypt and libya and my office has made a comparison between those resolutions and the actions of the commission its blueprint for change and it does not give me much courage
we are wasting our words here unless the commission listens to us and unless the council listens
so as i say i am publishing this analysis on my website
i believe that the lisbon treaty gave the european parliament additional responsibilities
we must be taken seriously by the other elements in the foreign policy of the european union
especially at a time of massive change in the arab world we all need to work together
