mr president over the years europe and the rest of the world have fought to battle discrimination on all levels
our progression as decent humans demands that we do just that respecting perfectly the subsidiarity principle
as mrs buitenweg has stated the commission has promised for over four years now to pass a broad and inclusive proposal on the human rights of all people
this is now coming finally to fruition
i strongly believe that no person should ever be discriminated against on the basis of his or her religion or belief disability or age
on the contrary as a christian believer i call upon the european parliament and each individual to not only stop discrimination but to help those who are being discriminated against because of their disability
this help can come from us in different shapes and forms
each member state has constantly persisted in improving equal access to those who need it the most
as europe continues to integrate it is paramount that we remember that we are all different yet perfectly equal in all regards
