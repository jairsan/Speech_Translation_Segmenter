mr president the plight of christians in the middle east asia and africa is no accident
this is not a series of regrettable but uncoordinated attacks
on the contrary it is classic mass persecution
the christians are intimidated evicted or killed with a clear purpose religious cleansing
this is happening as we here in europe are bending over backwards to accommodate the endless sensibilities of muslim believers
the result is a europe full of mosques and the middle east purged of christians
but this is not about numbers
it is about liberty and identity
even for those among us who do not believe christianity should be more than a forgotten exotic and diminishing sect
we are free to believe or not but we are not free to see our freedoms abused
this approach means that we should make religious freedom a precondition in our relations with sovereign states
this approach should be inscribed into law and become part of the high representative's mandate
