madam president i would like to congratulate commissioner rehn on his position on the oomen-ruijten report which was that it is essential for turkey to proactively support the ongoing talks between the leaders of the two communities in cyprus
that is why we are in full agreement with the rapporteur when in paragraph forty of her report she calls on turkey to facilitate a suitable climate for negotiations by withdrawing turkish forces and allowing the two leaders to negotiate freely their country's future
i would suggest that at this moment of direct talks it might not be advisable for the european parliament to include in its report any proposal for derogations from the acquis
to complement the rapporteur's position we also call on turkey to comply with its obligations regarding investigations into the fate of missing persons and to stop interfering in the republic of cyprus exclusive economic zone
in so doing turkey will itself facilitate its way towards accession
