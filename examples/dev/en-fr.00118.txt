mr president i would not normally rise on such a point
as a vice-president i respect the chair
however the groups have all been told that the calendar votes which are very limited i think there are two amendments will take place at the beginning of the voting session and not after mr schmitt has spoken to the house
i think it is disrespectful to mr schmitt to allow people to go and then ask them to come back again for two votes after his speech
i therefore ask you to put to the house the proposal to modify the agenda that all votes today take place before mr schmitt's speech and we start on the basis of the calendar votes
