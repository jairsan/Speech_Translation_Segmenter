mr president i am sorry to prolong this but as it happens the voting lists have been circulated to all the groups
if this was an error it needs to be corrected
it is ridiculous and disrespectful to the president of one of our member states and currently in the presidency to call the members back to the house back to the chamber after he has spoken
let us do it now in the order in which it is on the voting paper
there is no justification for changing this again
