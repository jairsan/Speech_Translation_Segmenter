mr president i should like to summarise the reasons why i voted against the resolution
first strengthening the state's role is the wrong answer in looking for a way out from the financial turmoil
second higher regulation and the creation of a new pan-european supervisory authority without clarification of competences are not a remedy to the crisis
third having been rejected by the people of ireland the lisbon treaty cannot enter into force
that is why the european council should respect the outcome of the irish referendum
fourth the european council is not willing to go back on its own unrealistic and extremely expensive targets concerning climate change
this will ultimately harm the living standards of ordinary people
