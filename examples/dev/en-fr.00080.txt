what is the minister representing the presidency going to do to protect groups of our fellow citizens who are at risk from poverty and social exclusion as a direct result of spanish policy towards british and other member state residents in various areas of spain whose properties are being expropriated and who are suffering under dubious planning policies
the minister on behalf of the presidency cannot evade this issue anymore he must pursue the spanish government and invite them to take the necessary action
