mr president i rise yet again to complain about the time management of this parliament
both yesterday and today we were given a time to vote and we have abused it yet again
surely the sign of a well run and effective parliament is one that can manage its affairs properly and to time
can you please urge the authorities to get a grip of this
otherwise we will be treated with the contempt we deserve
