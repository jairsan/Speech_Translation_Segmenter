mr president i am very pleased to be having this debate today with a view to the vote on wednesday
hopefully our work will shake the council out of its inertia and trigger productive negotiations allowing us to fulfil our objective of having a common european asylum system by twenty twelve and thus taking into consideration the hard work we have all put into this file
i would like to warmly thank mrs guillaume for her excellent work and her conciliatory approach
on the whole the result is a good text which includes significant improvements with respect to the asylum procedures currently implemented in the eu which vary enormously from member state to member state
to name but a few new provisions have been introduced to ensure each applicant is provided with adequate means to substantiate his or her claims in order to reach an asylum decision within a six-month period such as the personal interview and free advice on procedural and legal aspects in first-instance procedures including the preparation of the necessary procedural documents
