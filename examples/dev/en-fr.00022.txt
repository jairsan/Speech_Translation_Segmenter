madam president i have been deluged with messages from growers from all over the south-east of england who regard this proposal as near catastrophic
it will result they tell me in smaller crops and in higher prices and it will open the way for importers who do not have the same criteria imposed upon them
there will be job losses some units will become non-viable and production will stop
there will be closures in my constituency because there are in some cases no alternatives to key substances used by specialist growers
there has been hopelessly inadequate impact assessment in many countries except my own and the switch from risk assessment to hazards has already been commented on
if you are going to use hazards as criteria you might as well ban petrol and caffeine
even the science is against you pest resistance problems will be aggravated there will be a loss of biodiversity
integrated pest programmes have already decreased the need for pesticides
what is important are the options not quantity
and you seem to have ignored the benefits of crop rotation
you have no right to destroy one of the few sectors of british agriculture still thriving just to appease danish disinclination to process drinking water from the ground
