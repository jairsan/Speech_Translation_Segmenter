mr president i should like to thank the rapporteur for her work
let me make a few points on the strategic energy review and the last energy crisis problem which are closely linked
my first point in our report which calls on the member states to speak with a single european voice on energy issues we have explicitly stated what all europeans have seen in the past weeks to be the reality namely that damaging energy supply in the member states afflicts the european union as a whole
it is very important
this is the basis of european solidarity and a basis for developing emergency response measures
my second point is that the report mentions ccs technology as having the potential to meet our environmental targets while exploiting a source of energy coal that is largely available in europe
by developing ccs europe can become a world leader in advanced technologies which will contribute to our global competitiveness and strengthen our economies
the same is true for coal gasification technology which is very important as an additional source of gas supply it means diversification of gas supply
my third point is that this strategic document specifically underlines the need for investment in the energy supply infrastructure
infrastructure projects that receive support at eu level should first and foremost contribute to the real diversification of sources and routes of supplies to the member states and to the eu as a whole
investment in ukraine seems to be of special importance for us
together with our ukrainian partners we could in the future take the joint responsibility for gas deliveries on the russian-ukrainian border
the reason for such a step on our part is very simple
in terms of energy relations ukraine identifies with international standards
it has ratified the energy charter treaty and therefore plays by transparent rules
my fourth point is that our strategic document greatly complements our efforts towards implementing the third energy package
what does it mean
it means a working internal market in energy for the european union it means solidarity and support on many sides
let us finish the legislative procedure during the next three months
it is very important for us
