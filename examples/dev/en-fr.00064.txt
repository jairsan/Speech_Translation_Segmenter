madam president i have asked for the floor today to inform you of a rather disturbing fact that has come to my knowledge whilst on a visit to washington dc as part of the committee on civil liberties justice and home affairs delegation
on the margins of the current transatlantic negotiations on data protection swift pnr the united states is expanding its national security agency data-collection facilities so as to intercept every electronic message within its territory as well as all messages coming in and out of the country
how can the us pretend to respect the right to privacy when it is building an enormous eavesdropping agency and how can we just sit to one side and let that happen
it is our responsibility to raise awareness of this gross abuse of power and violation of our basic rights
i hope you will join me in informing our voters and the citizens in our countries about this through declarations and articles to the press
