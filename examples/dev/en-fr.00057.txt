mr president i welcome the idea of a strategy for the black sea region as a pilot project for the macro-regional strategies
initiatives of this kind allow the coordination of eu policy instruments in order to have a coherent stable and sustainable development of the regions involved
on the occasion of the last council it was said that a strategy would have been developed for the black sea region by the end of two thousand and nine
this is an extremely important initiative as it can bring about harmonised development and prosperity for the region that in comparison with the black sea area is far more complex in terms of actors involved and relevant for security stability energy and the environment
so i would like to ask the swedish presidency when such a strategy for the black sea region will be delivered and when parliament will be informed and involved in this issue
