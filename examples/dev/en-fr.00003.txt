mr president the whole climate change programme has given the eu yet another excuse to flex its muscles and show the world how important it is claiming that this is an issue that nation states cannot deal with alone
the twenty twenty twenty slogan is a typical example of a catchy phrase to work with twenty of energy in the eu from renewable sources a twenty reduction in carbon emissions all by the year twenty twenty
but you are missing the most important point is any of this necessary
we were told recently by the ipcc that two five hundred scientists were all in agreement that co was responsible for global warming and that we humans were the culprits
al gore's infamous film confirmed that view
since then however over thirty five hundred scientists and climatologists have signed the oregon petition and the manhattan declaration which directly challenges the ipcc conclusions with some very compelling evidence
so whilst we are urged to believe the ipcc's two five hundred scientists we are being told to completely ignore the thirty five hundred scientists who are painting a different picture
the eu is persuading nations across the world to spend billions of taxpayers money at the very time when the world is facing dire financial problems on something that might not only be totally unnecessary but could well prove to be counter-productive if the latest evidence of global cooling proves to be correct
we must have a full and open debate to prove exactly who is right
what do supporters of the ipcc's position have to fear
you will no doubt be pleased to hear that this will be my very last speech in this parliament since i retire after this session
