mr president bulgaria and romania proved that they can guarantee the safety of the eu borders and this is fully i repeat fully documented
by the way the officers arrested in romania and bulgaria were arrested for corruption
can anyone in this house claim that for instance a dutch officer a corrupt dutch officer would not be arrested for corruption in the netherlands
secondly romania and bulgaria did not compete to win the top prize of transparency international
they entered the judicial contract and fulfilled all its criteria
now if somebody is trying to change the rules of the game during the game i think this might be illegal according to eu law and is anyway unfair according to common sense
