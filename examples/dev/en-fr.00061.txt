madam president compared to the two thousand and nine budget the commission proposal for twenty ten provides for a moderate increase in the budget lines concerning internal market and customs policy whereas the amount of money allocated to consumer policy remains stable
in the draft twenty ten budget the council has decreased the money in particular for budget lines which concern the development of the internal market
i believe that a functioning internal market in these times of economic crisis can contribute to the economic recovery
in the area of customs policy the budget will assure cooperation and coordination measures thus reinforcing security and protection of external borders supporting the fight against illicit trafficking and fraud as well as improving the efficiency of customs systems
i consider measures in the area of consumer education a priority in particular the strengthening of financial literacy
the crisis has shown how important consumer policy in particular consumer education is in order to help consumers take responsible economic decisions
for all these reasons the imco committee called for a separate budget line on the solvit programme to be financed by an amount of eur one million
solvit is a very good example of how you can help businesses and citizens
finally for the continuation of the pilot project monitoring measures in the field of consumer policy for the consolidation of a scoreboard and related market study as a preparatory action the amount adopted is eur one million
