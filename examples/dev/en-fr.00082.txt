mr president usually when this house makes a resolution which has even a slight connection with the situation in the middle east it is hard to find mutual understanding
that is not so in this case thanks to the colleagues who have made it possible
the situation of gilad shalit is a humanitarian issue and our joint resolution underlines the fact that since being taken hostage nearly four years ago he has been kept in an unknown place in gaza where he does not enjoy basic rights according to any humanitarian standards including the third geneva convention
it is from this humanitarian perspective that we demand the immediate release of gilad shalit
meanwhile the minimum requirement is that the red cross and shalit's parents may be allowed to be in contact with him
the value of a human person cannot be measured
it is immeasurable
gilad shalit should not be made a bargaining chip by the terrorist organisation hamas but should be released immediately
this is the message that we would like the high representative baroness ashton to take with her to gaza during her forthcoming visit
