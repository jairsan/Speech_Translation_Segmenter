mr president i have to say at the outset that i very much welcome the communication which has been prepared by the commission
i think it is both comprehensive and ambitious
in my report commissioner i recommend which practical actions investments and processes are needed if we are to identify that very special place for children in external action
the commission and the council communication and conclusions on external action will build upon the external dimension of the eu strategy on the rights of the child
i believe that this is essential work for the european union
commissioner i now look forward very much to seeing actions intended to match the ambition which i see
we need to see substance backing up the rhetoric
that means that resources must be available and of course as i am sure you will agree there must be no backtracking by the european union member states on the commitments they have made to fund the millennium development goals mdg
what we know is that for most of the world's two billion children it is a daily struggle against poverty and vulnerability
as we know ninety-eight of the children in our world living in extreme poverty are living in developing countries
furthermore it is now clear that the impact of the financial crisis will be severely felt by children and young people for instance when the budgets are cut back on health and education
that is why i think it is right that we make a political commitment at the highest level on behalf of and with children
the eu must see in its partnership with the developing countries the opportunity to influence public policy to save children's lives
priority actions for children must be promoted when the european commission negotiates the country strategy papers regional and thematic strategies when they are drawn up and subsequently when they are reviewed
when there is budget support including mdg budget contracts specific objectives and indicators on children must and should be included
i welcome the commission's intention to draw up partner national action plans for children
we need assurances that even the most marginalised children including children with disabilities and orphans have access to equitable health welfare and judicial services
i believe there needs to be more and better training of commission staff both in brussels and in delegations particularly in how they manage the participation of children
we need to see a radical rethink in the european union about how we ensure that we listen to children and invite children to participate because we understand that it is children themselves who give lives to the values that are enshrined in international law through the convention on the rights of the child agreed in nineteen eighty-nine
it is my experience that the children themselves the young people have a wealth of understanding and experience which we must tap into on how to tackle poverty and environmental degradation
i welcome the fact that the commission recognises the importance of consultation during the preparation of the eu strategy on the rights of the child
i also understand that this has been planned for the first half of two thousand and nine
commissioner would the commission be able to confirm when this process will begin
i trust there will not be any decision that the public consultation including with children will be put on hold until a new commission and parliament is in place
finally to quote kofi annan there is no trust more sacred than the one the world holds with children
there is no duty more important than ensuring that their rights are respected that their welfare is protected that their lives are free from fear and want and that they grow up in peace
i think all of us would agree that those are fine objectives
