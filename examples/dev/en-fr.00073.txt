mr president i welcome the opportunity to support this resolution
the copenhagen summit was a disappointment in many respects
the eu failed especially in demonstrating a unified and efficient approach to climate change treatment as well as in strengthening its leading political position in this agenda
i consider therefore taking this resolution an act of utmost importance in order to demonstrate the unbroken spirit and determination of the eu as the leading force in the world in combating climate change
we have to enhance and promote further activities aimed at climate change treatment
