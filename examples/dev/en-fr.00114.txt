madam president i would like to inform you that democracy in romania has never seemed under so much pressure during the last twenty years
we have already alerted you regarding the president of the chamber of deputies who falsified the vote for the all-important pensions law
the recent case of the social democrat constantin nicolescu the chairman of the <unk> county council in romania proves once again that the methods used by the governing party in romania brutally threaten the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens
all the measures adopted by the government demonstrate that the democratic liberal party in romania is at war with the entire romanian people
we cannot allow a democratic member of the european union to behave undemocratically arresting people at will and using public institutions to carry out personal vendettas
together we must defend our rights our freedoms and our democracy
