mr president the citizens of europe need a strong union with a competitive foreign security and defence policy
this will not happen if our union keeps idle in one place
china and india are growing not only in economic power but also in military might
europe's competitive advantage should be based on knowledge and innovation
this should be nurtured and supported by all of us
in an effective security strategy our european forces should have access to equipment and resources of the highest quality
while the united states spends trillions of dollars on security we in europe are slow or idle in developing our own strategy
in a time of crisis we are closing firearms factories like the factory in radom poland
we should instead be investing in advanced technologies such as the recoilless technologies being developed in poland as we speak
innovation creates new business and jobs
we cannot build european capabilities by shutting down our own factories
