madam president i would just like to thank the colleagues who have contributed to the debate today and reiterate my point that we are looking at correcting mistakes made in the past and not at making any substantive changes
that will come later on with the real revision of the guidelines and of course we are looking forward to that debate
for this reason the rapporteur mr simpson and myself as coordinator for my group will be instructing my own political group to vote against the amendment put forward by the greens
we hope that the other political groups will be able to support us on this
