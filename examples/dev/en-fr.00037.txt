madam president these three very extremely important reports have been drafted by socialist rapporteurs
this of course is not by chance
the thrust of these reports the amendments that will be presented by the socialist members to improve them and also i think today's debate show very clearly that there are distinctive policies distinctive right-wing and socialist policies towards the crisis
the right-wing policy is pretty simple the crisis is a bad thing but we need to be patient it will pass we need to take some technical measures and things will calm down by themselves and we must express our sympathy to the people who will be hit
the socialist position is much more complex
we say that we must attack the roots of the problem the roots of the crisis that we must radically change the economic paradigm that we must change and that we must curb all the speculation that has led us to this financial crisis
this has not been a neutral crisis but a crisis inflicted by specific policies mostly by right-wing governments
