madam president i wish to thank everyone who has been working very hard on the seemingly never-ending story of sis ii mr coelho and those in the field
the issue of recurring delays and cost overruns is very worrying and if not this what else could be more telling about mr barroso's management skills in his first commission
i believe that we should take these lessons which can be learnt here today and project them into the creation of a new it agency which could be situated in tallinn
this would be a win-win situation while the french colleagues could keep the servers in strasbourg the new programming work would be done in tallinn by competent specialists with low management costs thus avoiding a monopoly and embracing the idea of eu integration and also giving a guarantee of data protection
finally i would like to express my confidence in commissioner malmstr√∂m's ability to resolve these complicated issues
