mr president today is four may and this will be my last speech here
however thirty years ago today mrs margaret thatcher was elected as british prime minister and she faced similar socialist-caused problems to those that we face today crippling debts rising unemployment and public unrest
she understood the solution was small government individual freedoms and national self-determination
today the eu imposes big government increasing central control and the erosion of the nation state
i can also remember her saying no no no words the eu ignores or does not understand
she went on to make that now famous speech in bruges that sparked opposition to the project
the eu is a fifty year-old attempted answer to a two hundred year old problem
i maintain if the eu was the answer it must have been a very silly question
and as they say in star wars may the fourth be with you
