mr president i support the environmental goals for twenty twenty but i have some serious doubts about some methods
the copenhagen conference was a good example of a bad method
and what were the lessons
the conference was too massive to be productive a rock concert of fifty zero people is possible a meeting not
secondly europe was outfoxed by china and india and the us joined in
instead of being a decisive player the eu was a confused spectator
what should we do
i think we have to reassess the form we used rather a g twenty than an event of woodstock proportions
secondly we have to stop displaying moral arrogance by telling china and india what to do
important barriers to punish both countries would be disastrous
on the contrary the eu should re-examine its own stance which will ultimately undermine our own growth and employment
finally we need serious research on the body of evidence
climategate was already a reminder and the claim that the himalayan glaciers are retreating now seems to be based on speculation
some members of the ipcc now even predict global cooling
we need objective impartial scientific research and not an agenda-driven political activism
what is true and what is not at present we simply do not know and i think we need to have the facts right first
commissioner minister i hope you will look at these questions with an open mind
