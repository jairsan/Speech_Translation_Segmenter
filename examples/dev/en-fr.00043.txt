mr president we are grateful to mr lax for his best efforts to achieve a compromise in such an ambitious project
the greens efa group still believes that the amendment suggested by parliament would be the best solution
for example there could be and there will be practical problems while dealing with the main destination instead of our proposal to provide free choice when applying for visas
the council has agreed to the obligation of the member states to cooperate only
unfortunately the visa fee will be eur sixty instead of the eur thirty-five suggested by parliament
hopefully there are a number of waivers and reductions for children students and active youth
although it was not possible to achieve a compromise on issuance of multiple-entry visas by default at least we have now an obligation to issue such visas in certain cases
the right to appeal against a negative decision is also a big step forward
now in many member states such a right does not exist
as a human rights activist in my previous life i especially thank mr lax for this provision
of course for my group incorporation in the report on visas of the report on biometrics looked like a fly in the ointment
we are against such a wide introduction of biometrics
still we see some improvements in the visa policy and therefore we will support this report
