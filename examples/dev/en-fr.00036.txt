mr president at the heart of this directive is the problem of control and of costing
how can we ensure that laws adopted by the eu as a whole are applied and how can we legislate without knowing the cost of what we want
the rapporteur wants to bring in a universal system of uniform emission limits which would have to be worked out in a huge bureaucratic exercise that would take at least eight years
no one knows how much it would cost it is called the european safety net
i tabled amendment one hundred and thirty-four on staying outside the high-emission industries with standards based on best available techniques leaving the implementation of such measures to the discretion of the member states
that is realistic and affordable and observes the principle of subsidiarity
if the european safety net is adopted i hope the council and the commission put pressure on parliament to have an impact assessment done on the idea
the question is whether we have the will to make a uniform european union-wide system a european safety net work
the answer is that all the evidence so far shows that member states lack that will
they will not support a european environment inspectorate they want to stick with national enforcement agencies
the right answer to our quandary is not to invent a huge new bureaucracy that will never spring into life but to use our money to bring up the standards of morale of national enforcement agencies to do their job in helping to put eu law into practice
i commend to you amendment one hundred and twenty-nine which exempts standby generators in healthcare facilities from pollution controls that would treat them as though they were operating one hundred of their time
that amendment will save money at a critical time for health budgets
i commend to you the amendments on large combustion plants unless we get these into the directive my country will face power blackouts
people have enough to blame the eu for without that my final point concerns compromises and mr turmes's attack on me the first reading is not a time for compromises but rather a time when we fire off all our amendments and ideas and discuss them
we cannot have compromises that prevent discussion
finally i commend to the future parliament the current rule fifty-five which would allow us to have a renewed first reading of this very important directive
it seems wrong to have the first reading in the old parliament and the second reading without a first reading in the new one
