mr president there is a saying that if you are not at the table you are on the menu
the next decade will decide where europe is going to be
the current leading generation in western europe had a holiday from history
we grew up in peace
we grew up in a welfare state
we made debts and passed them on to our children
but history is knocking on our door
we will have a sluggish economy for years to come we are facing mounting immigration and are sustaining an ageing population
unfortunately europe does not have a culture of achievement
the european dream is to retire to the french riviera as soon as possible
if we do not innovate and develop an entrepreneurial culture as you designed europe will be on the menu
i count on your leadership
may i give you one piece of advice keep europe focused on its core task
if you fail there you will fail everywhere
remain open-minded and do not propose a european tax because it will provoke a pitchfork revolution against europe
i have never seen a demonstration in favour of a european tax
it is simply a bridge too far and you will only feed public anger
i count on your sense of realism to get europe at the table and not on it and i wish you good luck in your second term
