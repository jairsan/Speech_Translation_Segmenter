mr president i have prepared a short statement for today which i should like to read
it is a great honour for me to be nominated vice-president of the european parliament with the support of the european people's party
it was a similar honour to receive the highest state decoration of romania the order of the star in december two thousand and nine at the commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the fall of communist dictatorship in romania
twenty years ago in <unk> people of diverse ethnic backgrounds and different beliefs united by understanding and courage and facing and running the same risks together rose up against the <unk> regime
in the same way as back then i continue my efforts today to represent my country's interests in the spirit of the fight for human minority and religious rights and for freedom while remaining committed to european and christian values
i am committed to furthering the european integration of former communist countries and nations in the eastern and central european region in particular that of the hungarian minority community in romania that i represent as a member of the european people's party
it fills me with joy to be a member of the european parliament in the period following the entry into force of the lisbon treaty which marks a new beginning in the history of a united europe
thank you for your attention
