lord dartmouth to a large extent i agree with your view but we also get indications from our interpreters that they cannot keep up with the pace
of course when i interrupt the speaker i always give him the additional time so everybody is happy the speaker is happy you are happy that you get the interpretation and of course our interpreters are happy as well
that is the purpose of the work we are doing here
