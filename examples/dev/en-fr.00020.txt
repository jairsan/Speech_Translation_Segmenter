mr president e-justice electronic justice can we say that such a thing is possible in an activity that is conditioned by human weaknesses and virtues which are very human characteristics
no can there be borderless justice
as you said no again because this is a human activity which is also very different in every part of the world
do those two nos mean that we must turn our back on technological innovation
again of course no we must try to exploit human innovation
a portal for information yes exchange of data yes awareness of the interindependence of the judicial systems yes contribution to the creation of a european demos yes but for common faceless justice and i do not say that you are doing that in your report no my father who was a judge would not be too eager for me to defend electronic justice before the european parliament
if i myself speak from the european parliament to my father who is in heaven i can tell him that i know that justice will always be a man his defender and a judge not before god but before their conscience
