mr president returning from the gaza strip after seeing the massacre predominantly of civilians i feel the urge to express my wholehearted solidarity with the palestinian people
for seventeen days they have been facing the enormous israeli war machine that is flagrantly violating international law
i also express support for the peace forces in israel calling for an end to this war
after a long closure and siege that converted gaza into the largest open prison in the world the building of the shameful wall around the west bank the continuous expansion of the settlements and the effective division of the palestinian land the occupying forces have moved to the fiercest military operation
in this the rocket attacks against southern israel and i stress that i am against any attack from whichever side on civilians served as the pretext
the ending of the ceasefire against the background of the power games in view of the israeli elections is an insult to a whole nation
the un security council has adopted a resolution
israel is a state not an organisation it is a member of the united nations
it has a responsibility towards the international community and has to comply with this and all other resolutions adopted by the united nations
there should be respect for international law
no impunity should be permitted any longer
there should be a full international investigation
the international community demands an immediate ceasefire the immediate withdrawal of the military forces access to humanitarian aid and freedom of movement for the population
let unwra carry out its mission
the eu has taken steps but only at a humanitarian level
it has to show decisiveness at the political level
use the clauses in the association agreements
stop the upgrading of relations with israel
stop arms exports to israel
there can only be a political solution to this conflict
there should be a full return to international law which means ending the forty-two year-long occupation of palestine and establishing a sovereign and viable palestinian state thus building a peaceful future for both palestinian and israeli children
to save future generations we need to stop the war now
