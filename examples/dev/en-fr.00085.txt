madam president the chair of the committee on transport and tourism mr simpson is not able to join us today and has asked me to read out his statement
the recast on the development of the guidelines of the ten-t network seeks to bring together the various amendments adopted over the years to the guidelines and to incorporate amendments that take account of the enlargement of the eu to twenty-seven member states
to give a bit of background to the report the guidelines give direction to the development of the trans-european transport network
the objective is to establish the network gradually by twenty twenty by integrating land sea and air transport infrastructure networks throughout the union
turning back to the report at hand it is strictly speaking a codification of the legislative text but because the commission made some minor changes to the annex they were forced to do it via the recast procedure
the changes to the annex are to correct initial mistakes that were made during the accession of the ten new member states that joined in two thousand and four
the changes are not about updating the maps or making any substantive changes
the two changes the rapporteur has introduced to the report involve minor modifications in the recitals and some technical corrections to the maps
these are in line with the changes made by the council and in line with correcting the guidelines
following the commission's advice the decision was taken both by council and by mr simpson as rapporteur with the backing of the transport committee not to make any substantive changes to the guidelines
the rapporteur is however aware that the greens have retabled their own amendments seeking to update the line between munich city and munich airport but the rapporteur would like to reiterate the point that the changes we are making in this report are about correcting the text not updating it
the point of this recast is to bring everything into order ahead of the real revision of the guidelines during early twenty eleven
it is important to ensure the clarity of the guidelines in preparation for the more substantial changes that will take place next year
we are all eagerly awaiting the real revision of the guidelines and the chance to further develop the ten-t network but in order to get to that stage we need to get the current legislation right and that is what we have done here
