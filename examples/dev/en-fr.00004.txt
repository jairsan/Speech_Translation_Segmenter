mr president it is always a pleasure to speak on matters which will enhance the steady growth of one of the most important international relationships in the globe that between the european union and the republic of india
we call in our resolution for those involved in the summit to explore further ways of upgrading this relationship and we look forward to concrete results which will be reported back to this parliament
it is a critical time for the summit
we paid tribute in our resolution to the september victims of terrorism in india including those killed in the assault on the indian embassy in kabul
but today surely we must also pay tribute to those heroes who saved lives in islamabad and we must remember that india lies at the heart of a region that is in considerable security difficulties
it is proper that the wish in our resolution that there should be greater intelligence-sharing should be taken up and honoured and all efforts to support india in her fight against terrorism with us should be supported including we believe a seat on the united nations security council
in our resolution we call also for a peaceful future for the former princely state of jammu and kashmir on both sides of the border and now split into two nations
peace comes as we know so well with the european union with employment with jobs and it is particularly pleasant to learn that india is at present in jammu and kashmir building the longest railway tunnel in the globe which will be nearly eleven km long as part of a one hundred and forty-eight km long section of track
this will be the longest in the world ninety-five complete which gives three nine hundred new jobs of direct employment and i am sure many thousands more to come
and culture we call too for greater links with culture
this is the year of dialogue and india has much to teach the european union on this
we call for more people-to-people dialogue and i am sure that is the way forward
in conclusion i urge colleagues to support this excellent resolution
