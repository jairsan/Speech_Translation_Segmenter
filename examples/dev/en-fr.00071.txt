mr president the information about violence against christians in egypt and malaysia is just the tip of the iceberg
there are three points i want to raise
first christians have become the victims of brutal violence in many countries of the world not just two
second christians have become the single most persecuted religious group in the world
the numbers are astounding in the millions not thousands or hundreds of thousands
third the reaction of european societies european governments and the eu has so far been unsatisfactory timid faint-hearted pusillanimous politically correct or no reaction at all
we must act resolutely or else those who persecute christians will think they have our tacit blessing
do we really want this
