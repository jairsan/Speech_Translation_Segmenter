mr president i do not share the opinion that an ongoing uprising in egypt is dominantly driven by forces longing for democracy of a european style
i see the current riots and chaos as a revolution for change that is motivated by striving for a better life
but the crucial question for us europeans is the threat that the dramatic situation could be abused by radical islamists
if there were such a dramatic political change europe as well as america would lose a moderate arabic ally and the egypt peace treaty would be endangered
egypt can quickly and easily turn into a regime that is hostile to europe israel and america and become close to hamas
the position of the eu should stay firmly on the side of those who are striving for freedom and who relentlessly support free elections
