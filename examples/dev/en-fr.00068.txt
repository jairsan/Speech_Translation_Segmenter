mr president we as liberals are against the death penalty in general but here the death penalty in china is used to oppress minorities like the tibetans the uighurs and others
furthermore china is not a democracy
human rights are not respected
china has a harsh policy against taiwan
china should be put under pressure
this is difficult i know
it is an enormous market but we should fight for our principles
therefore we support this resolution
