mr president very briefly i am trying to be helpful but am getting hungry
these are important votes and it is a very full agenda and i have every sympathy with you
i have just been down to the press room and i note that eight journalists are actually listening to the vote others may be watching on the screens where every single vote is being broadcast
i therefore think that to read out the result of every vote is not necessary
