mr president as a member of the delegation that went to palestine last week it became clear to me that there are a number of sensible people who believe that the two-state option is dead in the water largely because of israeli actions not least the proposals to extend the wall even further into and beyond east jerusalem thereby dividing the west bank into the north and the south
what interests and what actions are we likely to take if the single-state option becomes a reality
secondly are the presidency and lady ashton aware of how much the views of again sensible people about the charade that passes off as the quartet is prevalent amongst a number of people
what actions are we going to take to ensure that the cost of this operation is matched by its effectiveness which presently is nil
