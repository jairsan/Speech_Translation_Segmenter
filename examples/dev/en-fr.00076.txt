mr president there is guilt on both sides but an overreaction on the part of israel over this report and indeed over operation cast lead
goldstone is a respected judge of considerable repute and jewish
there are undoubtedly flaws in this report but israel must recognise that the core of the criticism is based on fact
you only have to listen to israeli soldiers who admit to their dubious activities on occasions in the organisation breaking the silence
israel has been forced to admit the use of white phosphorous as a result of this inquiry so why has there been no real investigation into the actions of some of their soldiers who have been involved in potential if not actual war crimes
the plc has admitted its transgressions but israel on this issue and on the recent dubai assassination must cease to be so arrogant and recognise the justified concern of sensible decent people throughout the world
