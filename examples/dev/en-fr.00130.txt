mr president ukraine is a democracy
therefore we signal our concern to a partner an ally and a friend
as we all know nobody is perfect in this world but it is in accordance with europe's political standards and norms and also in accordance with the logic and values of democracy that we expect the ukrainian authorities not to abuse their power by encouraging and holding politically motivated trials and instead to give those who are suspects a fair trial rather than political retribution
yulia tymoshenko and other members of the former government of ukraine who had long been the rivals of president yanukovych should not be regarded as collectively or by association guilty and responsible for what is perceived as a liability in political practice
first and foremost they are all citizens of a democratic state
by no means are we offering a defence speech here
instead we are merely reminding our friends how democracy works
