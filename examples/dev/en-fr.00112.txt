mr president sixty years ago revolution in the arab world meant the end of european colonial rule
the second revolution in the arab world is happening now in front of our eyes
this is the moment when the european union has to choose whether it stands on the right side or on the wrong side of history
the task is to help foster an independent civil society in the arab world
our budget in the eu must be reviewed to address the urgent needs of tunisia which has suffered from a twenty-three year-long autocracy
the majority of the tunisian people have no trust in this temporary unelected government
a truth process in tunisia is already beginning but the european union needs a truth process itself so great has its negligence of human rights and democratic values been in the arab world over the years
this is truly the time for human rights
