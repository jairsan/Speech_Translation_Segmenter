madam president commissioner the importance of the black sea region for the eu from the transport energy stability security and environmental point of view is evident
it is for this reason that the eu strategy for this region will certainly have a very positive impact on the area and on the eu as a whole
the committee on regional development believes this strategy can bring growth and sustainable development for the region
but also it is of the opinion that for full effectiveness it is necessary to involve all the states of the region no matter whether they are member states or not
this strategy needs actions to be coordinated but how could this coordination exist without the proper involvement of all countries
coordination is certainly needed with the danube strategy which is soon supposed to become a major priority of the hungarian presidency
the use of an integrated approach and cross-border cooperation between the regions should be promoted in all fields of the strategy but in particular those of transport energy and the environment
