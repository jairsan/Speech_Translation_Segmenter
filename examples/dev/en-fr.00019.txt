mr president many of our colleagues want to vote in favour of the idea in the green resolution not to make internet providers and telecom providers responsible for the content on the internet and so on but many of those colleagues who want to vote in favour of the green resolution do not like paragraph fifteen which is related to another subject
in a spirit of christmas compromise we would like in an oral amendment to withdraw paragraph fifteen from our resolution in order to enable more people to vote for it
