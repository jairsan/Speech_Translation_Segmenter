mr president my comments are for baroness ashton
vice-president high representative ashton you have very clearly heard this morning that parliament will fully support your leadership role and is demanding that you take the initiative in our common foreign and security policy
you have also heard the many questions by colleagues about who and which member states are blocking our common efforts
my suggestion to you would be that now that the european external action service is putting in place its rules on access to information and access to documents please make this a modern organisation which is accessible to citizens and which does not deal with foreign policy as if it were only the domain of some secretive diplomats
i am sure this would be the best way to boost our common efforts for a truly common foreign and security policy
