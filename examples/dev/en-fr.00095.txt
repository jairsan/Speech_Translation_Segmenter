madam president firstly i would like to convey my sympathy to the people of pakistan over the tragic loss of lives
i would also like to thank commissioner georgieva for her devoted work in making pakistan an urgent priority on her agenda
it took the world and the eu some time to comprehend the full scale of the disaster
now as we understand better the needs of the affected people our response should be urgent and match those needs
we need to provide more financial and material assistance while ensuring that help will reach everyone including minorities according to their needs
we must also not forget that pakistan is a frontline country in the international war on extremism and terrorism
if we fail to assist them then poverty and despair may strengthen militancy
a one-off humanitarian assistance effort will not do
it should be combined with help to rebuild the country's infrastructure roads bridges schools etc
we also need to take urgent measures to help pakistan in reviving its economy and trade
enhanced market access for pakistani exports and new debt arrangements could turn the tide
eu member states should seriously reconsider debt trade-off as a way to offer help in this tragedy
