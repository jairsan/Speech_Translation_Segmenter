mr president concerning amendment nine which my group voted against it was crucial for the ppe-de group that the democratic process should be completed without any short cuts that create a democratic deficit especially now that in the case of emission trading the parliamentary process cannot be described in a flattering manner
we have seen misleading tricks manipulation and finally the rapporteur ignoring the political will of her own group
this has become even more relevant given the deadlock in the council last week
the ppe-de group has offered a solution to the problem of damaging industry whilst advancing the climate change mitigation
therefore not only eu industry but also the trade unions are supporting our benchmarking proposal to replace the costly auctioning system
we are all united in the attempt to reduce harmful emissions
there is no doubt about that
the question is how to do it
our first concern must be our planet but i contend that the measures needed to stop climate change will not be helped by the economic decline of the leading climate-friendly economies leading to unemployment in the eu
