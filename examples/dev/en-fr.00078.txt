mr president roma the largest european minority are suffering from institutional discrimination anti-gypsyism extraordinary levels of poverty and social exclusion segregated systems in housing education and social welfare
short-term solutions are not an answer to the widespread and deep-rooted problems of roma
we need to evaluate existing good practices as well as the negative effects of existing policies for the roma population
one but not the only example is taking roma children away from their families and putting them in separate boarding schools
these measures do not solve problems they lead rather to more segregation and impact deeply and negatively on the lives of roma families
europe needs an effective long-term roma strategy
this summit gives us a new opportunity for affirmative action different from the first roma summit which did not include real political commitments in the eu
the eu should start by setting a good example by offering more positions to roma people and including roma and civil society in the strategy
