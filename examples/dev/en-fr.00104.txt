madam president i would like to address an issue that has been raised by many colleagues and that is the suppression of the rights of christians
i very much wish in the name of consistency that colleagues would be equally interested in repression of the rights of representatives of other religions because we are very often told by other countries that we are one-sided and biased so i think this is a question of real coherence and credibility
i would like the guiding line of the eu human rights foreign policy to be the avoidance of any double standards and i hope that the european parliament will stick to that
lastly can i ask baroness ashton if she is going to respond to the many questions that we have about the new human rights structures in the eas since these will be assembled in the very near future
