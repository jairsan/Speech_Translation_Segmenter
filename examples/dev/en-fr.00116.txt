mr president first i would like to thank the rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done
it is quite heartening that we are speaking with the same voice as the european commission
most importantly i would like to thank them for defending the prerogatives of this house
to my colleagues from the ecr i would say that this is not grandstanding but legitimately asserting our role in this process
in times of crisis we need effective solutions stability and predictability and all these features can be achieved best when we avail ourselves of the community institutions
intergovernmental solutions will not in the long run lead us anywhere
most importantly if we are serious about fighting economic crisis and being competitive we have to do it together regardless of whether a given member state is a part of the euro area or outside it
therefore i welcome the fact that in our position voted on yesterday in the committee on constitutional affairs of this house we have agreed to open the mechanism to all countries willing to participate in it thus dispelling the ungrounded fears of a two-speed europe
