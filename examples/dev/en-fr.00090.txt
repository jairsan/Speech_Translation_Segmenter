mr president i rise on a point of order to enquire whether it is going to become a precedent that we are to find on our desks in this house items of information relating to motions to sign
regardless of the merits or otherwise of the case surely it is to be deplored that we get junk put on our places over which we have no control whatsoever
can you please stop it
