mr president may i remind this house that one year ago communist abuses were met by a popular revolt in the republic of moldova
the protests brought to power a pro-european coalition and one year on the new government proved its european stance
the moldovan government needs immediate support from the eu and there are three ways in which european support can help moldova quick financial assistance abolishing of visas and the conclusion of an association agreement
i also have to mention here the case of ernest vardanian a journalist arrested held incommunicado and indicted for high treason by the so-called authorities in transnistria
it is a serious human rights violation
i am asking the high representative for foreign affairs and the eu head of delegation to moldova to act urgently for the immediate release of the detained journalist
