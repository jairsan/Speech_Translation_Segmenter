mr president firstly i would like to express my gratitude and give my sincerest congratulations and compliments to the rapporteur and fellow shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation and understanding
i would also like to thank my fellow green members for their cooperation and contribution
we can finally say that we have come up with a decent document allowing us the european union to proceed in a fairly reasonable manner taking into account all the interests of all stakeholders
even though the greens justifiably think that we should be even more radical we are still glad that this report takes our worries and concerns into account such as the proposals we made to the rapporteur concerning the fact that scientific data clearly demonstrates that the arctic ecosystem is currently going through massive climate-related changes and that this situation requires a precautionary and scientifically robust approach to be taken to any future development in the arctic
that is why we called for further scientific studies within the framework of a multilateral agreement to be completed to inform international understanding and decision making for the arctic ecosystem before any further major development goes ahead
we thank the other groups for accepting that
this is an example of how to put things in a congenial form for our wide range of different constituencies
there are some sceptics in this room who have stated that the arctic region does not deserve our attention but it does particularly with iceland likely to become the twenty-eighth member of the eu
the arctic is cool
this is not because of climate change and the consequent warming up of the normally cold high north
the arctic is also cool because of the lucrative possibilities emerging on the horizon even though they bring with them very complex and difficult problems
that is why i think politicians who tackle these problems in a responsible and politically subtle manner are cool politicians as are those of us who will vote for mr gahler's report today
