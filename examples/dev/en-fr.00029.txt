mr president i agree with the position that mr speroni has put forward
i recognise the difficulty you are in but i would suggest that he is right
the screens do record every vote
to read out every amendment result would be very time-consuming especially with a vote like we have today
i would suggest that you ask the bureau to remit it to the relevant committee and we will consider it for a future voting session if that is acceptable to the house
