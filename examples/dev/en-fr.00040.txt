mr president the committee on regional development and the funds put into the whole of europe are the most important programme in the whole of the european community
i can speak for north-west england and say how very much these funds have benefited the city of liverpool in particular over the last ten years
looking onward to the future i can see that city continuing to expand on the basis of these well-allocated well-controlled funds
i would call for more involvement of the private sector in the way that the funds are allocated managed and controlled because the private sector can always do a more efficient job than the public sector
i would also like to emphasise how very invaluable these monies have been to the rural areas of the north west where there are a lot of agricultural areas which are vital to the whole economy
finally let me say that i back mr becsey on his microcredit
this is a very interesting development and essential at this time in the economic situation
