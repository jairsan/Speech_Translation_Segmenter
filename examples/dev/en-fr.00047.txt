mr president i would like to congratulate mr skinner on this report
he has done an excellent job
it has been a huge undertaking but he has really delivered on this very complex piece of legislation
i would also like to congratulate the european institutions and member states who have brought us this successful conclusion of solvency ii
it is a good example of how europe must work together towards financial recovery
burdens will be shared as will solutions
this european approved response is a good example of a closer relationship on financial cooperation
we have to work to make sure that there is never again a banking crisis like the one we are going through at the moment
i did notice with great interest the commission's approval of a mortgage support scheme for uk homeowners
this scheme will allow householders who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments to defer all their principal and up to seventy of their interest payments for a period of two years
we should carefully follow the progress of this scheme and learn from and implement any effective measures that would ease the burden we carry
i think this is something that all member states can look at but i also think that financial institutions in member states themselves could make it easier for people to move to interest-only mortgages if they found themselves in difficulty
the financial institutions considering the support that they have from member state governments could do a lot to help people who are under stress because of the recession
