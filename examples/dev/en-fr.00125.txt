mr president eu citizens have a right to know the make-up of the clothes they wear and this regulation will allow them to avoid purchasing products containing non-textile parts of animal origin whether for health ethical or other considerations
when used in garments for example as trimmings such materials are currently not subject to mandatory labelling most consumers are unaware of this and may not know the exact make-up of the textiles they buy
eu legislation providing for this already exists for footwear and it makes sense to provide our consumers with the same level of information when they buy their clothes
allergy sufferers in particular stand to gain from this proposal as fur is potentially hazardous to their health and the commission must also study the possibility that potentially hazardous materials and chemicals used in textiles may lead to allergic reactions
future applications of new textile fibre names must include available scientific data on possible allergic reactions and other adverse effects on human health
it should be stressed that these are balanced proposals which exempt clothes made by self-employed tailors from such labelling requirements
