mr president in the case of online gambling there must be clear and unambiguous laws that serve to limit control and account for the nearly eur three billion in annual gross revenue realised by the gambling industry
however according to mrs schaldemose that eur three billion is only five of the total gambling market in the european union
therefore the importance and influence of this industry is obvious as are its dangers
gambling is often correctly associated with crime at international level and cross-border gambling rings which are much easier to run via the internet jeopardise the laws of various nations and harbour risks to national sovereignty
it is also important to note the negative effects on health associated with gambling
as a medical doctor i am well aware of the damaging characteristics of obsessive or addictive gambling
these are not issues that the european parliament can underestimate
when it comes to tackling fraud criminal behaviour and financial and medical issues that correspond to online gambling i call on the european parliament to vote repeatedly on better and better solutions in future
