madam president the re-launching of the single market has to be politically supported economically viable and socially acceptable to european citizens
no revival of the single market will be successful unless we convince citizens that the single market truly represents their interests
in this respect i am highly appreciative of commissioner barnier's strong commitment to take into account citizens concerns and aspirations
in fact commissioner barnier went the extra mile to reconcile conflicting views and tensions and to incorporate different priorities of the various stakeholders
however in its present form the single market act does not sufficiently address the social dimension which would ensure the right balance of an open economy stimulating growth and job creation but safeguarding in the process consumer protection and citizens rights
we must not lose sight of the holistic vision of the single market nor should we approach this act in a defeatist manner and there i agree with commissioner barnier that we should counter single market fatigue especially when that fatigue emanates from within the institutions
in my opinion the single market is not getting the political support urgently needed to ensure that it does not become yesterday's business
more political leadership on the single market from the presidents of the commission and council would go a long way towards achieving a viable single market to serve as a catalyst for economic recovery
we trust that commissioner barnier will acknowledge our concerns during the coming months of serious discussions
we must not lose this political momentum and this unique opportunity to revitalise the single market
i repeat that market integration is not an irreversible process and must not be taken for granted a weak and fragile single market would lead to more disintegration than integration for the european project
