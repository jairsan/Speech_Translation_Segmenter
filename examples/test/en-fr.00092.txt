what i would like to say is that the danish liberals are very pleased with today's vote on the readmission agreement between the eu and pakistan
finally after several years of negotiations between the commission and pakistan an agreement has been reached which will allow the readmission of migrants who no longer fulfil the conditions for entry to or residence in any of the eu member states
this agreement is an important instrument in the struggle against illegal migration into the european union especially because pakistan is an important country of origin and transit of migrants
with this agreement pakistan agrees to take back its own nationals and under certain conditions third country nationals too
this agreement will enhance security on european territory
