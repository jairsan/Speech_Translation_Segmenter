madam president i very much welcome the efforts of my colleagues insisting on a strategy for the danube region
coming from lithuania i am very well aware that member states alone are unable to achieve significant progress in terms of economic development environmental protection sustainable transport and tourism energy and many other areas
i am positive that regional strategies can be more effective and should be promoted because member states are then acting in the common interest
i wish my colleagues the determination to achieve their goals and i believe that their voice will be heard by the new commission especially because sustainable regional development is among the top priorities on the commission's agenda
