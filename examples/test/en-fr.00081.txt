mr president one of the key issues in the new lisbon treaty is the increased role of the european union in the world
with this new strengthened foreign policy we as a union must be more active in the promotion and defence of human rights and fundamental rights in third countries
what are you and mrs ashton planning to do to strengthen the eu's policy on the promotion of democracy
secondly will you be supporting greater funding for the european instrument for democracy and human rights in the next budget
human rights always seem to take second and third place in our dialogues
i think we need to spend more time and money on the promotion of democracy and build a true european endowment for democracy
i would like to hear your opinion on these issues
