madam president i supported this report
effective consumer enforcement policy is central to the functioning of the single market
we need to have a real and well-functioning internal market with a high level of consumer protection which unfortunately is not the case today
we have the legislation in place but it is not enforced properly in the member states
most importantly our consumers do not feel safe because they do not know the rules and in many cases the compensation mechanisms are not working in the way they should
the commission should increase its efforts ensuring that member states apply directives correctly and that citizens are informed about their rights and most importantly that they are able to exercise those rights in practice
