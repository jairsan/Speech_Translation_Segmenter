mr president parliament's resolution is timely and important
thousands of people are subject to caning in malaysia every year
caning is an inhuman and degrading form of punishment which should be abolished everywhere in the world
caning is a form of torture
according to amnesty international a muslim woman was caned last year in malaysia where sharia law is applied
the reason for the punishment was drinking beer
amnesty international has also reported on the caning of refugees and immigrant workers in malaysia
we urge the government of malaysia to abolish caning as a form of punishment
we also call on the malaysian government to ratify the protocol to the united nations convention on torture as well as the international covenant on civil and political rights
