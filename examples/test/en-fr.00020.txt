mr president for all those who observe the israeli-palestinian conflict this might be a time in which we are tempted to put our hands in the air and scream in despair
i do not think we should however because i think the greatest test of our humanity today is to really understand the issues at hand
the first issue is that there can be no lasting solution to this conflict without stopping the bombardment of israel
the second issue is that there cannot be a lasting solution to this conflict without opening gaza to humanitarian aid
indeed president peres has been absolutely right in saying that gaza should be open for aid and not enclosed for rockets
i think this is quintessential and everyone agrees to this
there cannot be a return to the status quo ante and i think we could do a number of things here
firstly parliament can bring both sides together to talk secondly we should stand behind the commission and the council and support their efforts and finally we should firmly support the egyptian track of negotiations because that is the only track that can lead to a solution and to the ceasefire which we currently all hope for
