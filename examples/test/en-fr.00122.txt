madam president i should like to say this to the vice-president high representative i appreciate very much what you said in your first speech on your policy and what you have been doing with north africa egypt tunisia libya and especially the focus you put on the young people and women there and your approach to deep democracy that has to be rooted
i think that is essential and all of us here in this house share that view with you so i hope this will be successful
on the other hand i agree with many of my colleagues that assad should have been included in the sanctions
as my colleague danny cohn-bendit asked you who is the one or who are the ones who blocked it in the council
is it mr westerwelle or who
tell us and you will find support from us if you are transparent and open with us
i think that will get support for you
explore your mandate
you will have more support here from us if you tell us more about what is going on in the council
go ahead and tell us
i think that is true for coherence as well as you and so many others here have said
in the albertini report that we will be voting on this week we also call for the national policies to be supportive of the eu positions and of you and i call on my colleagues here in the european parliament those of you who are from government parties in your own countries tell your foreign ministers and your prime ministers to support the common european policy and not just look into your own domestic interests including in foreign policy otherwise we will never get a common european foreign policy for which we need you baroness ashton to lead to be ambitious and to be bold in your commitments
sixty-one years after the schuman declaration which we celebrated two days ago we need more europe than ever
what we want is very concrete conflict prevention and civilian crisis management lady ashton
we demand that in the external action service we have independent impact assessments as a standard procedure for the qualitative evaluation of the security human rights gender social and economic effects of each csdp mission and we need more civilian personnel in these missions as well
