madam president i would like to refer this report back to committee under rule one hundred and sixty-eight two
both this democratically elected parliament and the european commission see the necessity to cover some modest forms of cooperation between the eu and developing countries actions that are not strictly speaking poverty alleviation such as exchange programmes between universities here and there
the budget for development is not meant for this kind of cooperation but some members insist on using a legal base that would lead us to finance these actions with the development budget while that is precisely what we seek to avoid with this report
we did not reach an agreement
if amendment one is adopted then this report would become incoherent and contrary to the interests of the world's poorest people
i consider therefore that we should refer this report back to the committee on development in order to agree on a legal base having the support of a clear majority of this house
