mr president i would like to say to the commissioner that while we were working on the report on your rich document we were just like yourself constantly conscious that the single market is there to serve europeans
maybe this is exactly the reason why the negotiations between different political groups on the final form of the text were so difficult
i do agree with them that even if we do not fall in love with the single market we can be very emotional about it
it is really good that the european parliament sends a clear signal today to the commission and to the council in the form of fifteen priority proposals and i am personally satisfied that we underlined the importance of the mobility of our citizens
better access to banking services easier recognition of professional qualifications full portability of pensions these are the fields in which citizens need solutions in order to study work and invest in different member states throughout their lives
europeans expect concrete actions from us for concrete needs and we must deliver
take for example voice and data roaming charges
it is high time these stop hindering the mobility of europeans on this continent our continent without internal borders
this issue is also addressed in the document we are going to vote on today
finally the european parliament is proposing an idea to organise an annual single market forum and this platform should enable a genuine discussion with citizens
to me this is a crucial way of involving european citizens in the reform of the single market for its twentieth anniversary and for that event i wish all of us much success
