mr president i voted in favour because the issue of energy supply security is of paramount importance today for all member states of the european union
the recent russian-ukrainian crisis has clearly demonstrated existing problems in the energy sector and especially the total dependence of some member states on single suppliers of natural gas
the baltic countries which are isolated from the rest of europe are left to the mercy of gas suppliers from eastern europe
now it is more important than ever to develop a comprehensive common energy policy based on solidarity the diversification of energy sources and defence of common interests
i would like take this opportunity to thank the commission and especially the swedish presidency for presenting the baltic sea strategy which will allow effective mobilisation of structural funds to be used more efficiently to achieve common goals
i am convinced that if properly implemented the strategy will become an example of regional success
finally i would like to urge the commission to take a leading role in the implementation of the baltic sea strategy in order to ensure that in certain cases the interests of individual member states do not take precedence over the achievement of common strategy goals
