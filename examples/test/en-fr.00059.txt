madam president i agree with those speakers who said we have a real opportunity in front of us with a new us administration in place
three quick points
firstly we seem to have evolved into a situation where we have a huge number of subjects which are discussed between the eu and the us but no strategic dialogue and yet they tell me in washington that the us and china have a much greater strategic dialogue than between us across the atlantic
is it not time at this summit to say that we want a strategic dialogue for a strategic partnership
secondly regarding the point on protectionism on the tec it is quite clear that the biggest danger in the next twelve months is closing markets rather than opening ones and yet we have the transatlantic market which is as mr brok said the biggest opportunity we have for generating growth on both sides of the atlantic
is it not time to make the transatlantic market a major part of trade development rather than putting it to one side as a regulatory issue
it is actually a major opener
lastly it is disappointing that we have no study and no road map as promised by mr verheugen
the study was paid for by parliament
if you want parliament to cooperate on saying how we now need to see how to open markets please release this report as the resolution says by fifteen november
