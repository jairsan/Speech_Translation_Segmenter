madam president i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report
i think that unlike the other guidelines which we have discussed over many others years in this house it is focused and it does not get into a whole lot of different details which are obviously to come later in the budget procedure
firstly i would like to say that we in my group would like to take very much into account what is happening elsewhere in the european union and not just keep it within the brussels beltway
therefore the paragraph you have put in paragraph twenty-one where you are saying that we should be looking for negative priorities and savings by the institutions asking our specialised committees to be able to look for priorities is very important but very little work has been done on this so far
tied in to the desire which i can fully understand to have more monies available for the europe twenty twenty strategy and the flagships we should be looking not just for actions which involve money but strengthening of the single market
it is not just about monies
where we are looking for monies we should be thinking about where we can be generating savings from elsewhere in the budget as we are looking to do in parliament and in the other institutions
we take the line that if you want more money then you can take it from savings elsewhere
this should also be an important part of our approach to the twenty twelve budget
lastly therefore in looking at the kind of responsibility we should take in an era of austerity if we are going to be able to cope with the savings of financing where we need new expenditure my group believes we should be heading for a freeze in our expenditure for twenty twelve
