madam president i would like to congratulate mr lange on an excellent report and a substantive one to make us think about the trends for industrial policy
as we come out of the biggest recession for the last sixty years we really have to galvanise our industries to be competitive in global markets backing small firms boosting enterprise and supporting all those who want to create jobs
so the linkage between innovation skills and sustainability is evident
not necessarily by using funds we can do this by strengthening the internal market trade promotion and providing a supportive framework for innovation
lastly one element missing for me is the digital agenda
everyone in europe every business should have the right to have access to the best it mobile and broadband at super speeds
were you aware commissioner that south korea fixed the aim last week to have by the end of next year internet speeds plugged into every home that will be two hundred times faster than those in the average household in the us
as was said by one senior it executive for europe's competitiveness one has to realise that it is much better enhanced by investing in it compared to physical infrastructure
