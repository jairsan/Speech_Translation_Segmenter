mr president i wish to begin by thanking the czech presidency for the successful summit
i think the summit has come up with a number of important decisions but at the same time i am of the opinion that we need more and we need to move faster
when we go to the g twenty meeting in london in a week's time i have the impression that we are still too integrated to act alone and too divided to act together
i see three main priorities that we should focus on
the first of course is jobs
millions of people in europe are afraid of losing their jobs and frankly i do not understand the position of the french president in opposing the summit a fully fledged summit is something we need at this moment
second i am happy that we managed to eliminate partly at least protectionist tendencies
nevertheless they are still alive and i think solidarity is the key
the third point the key is to restore confidence in the markets
i am not even of the opinion that there is too little money in the market i think there is enough money
the problem is to transform this money into effective demand and for that to happen we need to restore confidence among households and enterprises
