mr president first of all let me thank and congratulate ms kolarska-bobinska for an excellent report and then let me start with a little story from the real world
ten years ago china did not produce one single windmill today china houses one of the world's top ten wind-energy companies
in two years they expect to have two companies in the top five
ten years ago there was nothing
today china represents fifty of global windmill production
china is moving and they move fast
in this light i am sorry to say the commission's new energy strategy is discouraging in its lack of ambition for a greener future
we need an ambitious energy strategy for europe not only in a cop sixteen resolution that nobody reads anyway
we need to implement ambitious concrete policy targets in europe
when the time is right we can get ambitious <unk> to be the strategy of the council and commission
well the time is right and we cannot sit back and relax and wait for some grand international binding agreement before we act
for an energy strategy to deliver on climate on growth on jobs we need a much more ambitious and market-based approach so that we can use the market mechanism to our advantage
it is up to ourselves to create a drive in the market to show the pioneers where we want to go so that they can take us there
that is why alde is calling for the eu to move to a thirty co reduction target
the carbon market the main mechanism for our co reductions and green investments does not work
it is flooded with quotas and the price is too low so there are no incentives to invest in green technologies
we believe that the eu needs to make this move for the sake of our economic growth climate and energy security
come on europe come on commission let's walk the talk
