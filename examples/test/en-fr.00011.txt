mr president parliament defends individuals and small organisations small businesses as opposed to governments who want to sweep away inconvenient things and the committee on the internal market and consumer protection feels very strongly that the external land-border shops should be allowed to remain
they should be better policed as should all the policing against crime across borders in europe be much better but it is not a reason to sweep them away
secondly on sea and air travel the internal market committee believes strongly that travellers based on their final destination as opposed to a transit destination should be allowed to buy duty-free because that would help small regional airports generate revenue
it may be inconvenient to the governments but we defend it very strongly
the third and final point that i want to make which it is very regrettable that the commission did not include in its two thousand and six consultation on this legislation is the removal of these exemptions which it is now proposing
why did it not include it
why did it not carry out an impact assessment on what it would mean before it proposed it
