mr president i supported this report because i believe that it represents a step forward in combating fraud and tax evasion on a european scale
despite the willingness of member states to cooperate in the field of taxation tangible results have not been achieved and tax fraud remains at an extremely high level in the eu and brings far too many negative implications both to our economies and our citizens
i very much welcome the proposed new improvements which will hopefully produce tangible results in the fight against fraud and tax evasion especially the extension of the scope of the directive on all taxes including social security contributions the automatic exchange of information and improved cooperation between the member states in matters of taxation
