madam president the liberalisation of the visa regime for the western balkan countries is important as this measure matters most to ordinary citizens in the region and it will clearly show the benefits of the eu rapprochement process
i am confident that the conditional inclusion on the white list of albania and bosnia and herzegovina will prove to be a strong incentive for meeting the rest of the benchmarks on the road map
in our case back in two thousand and one such a strong signal was sent and in a couple of months we managed to fulfil all pending conditions
it is essential that albania and bosnia and herzegovina are included on the schengen white list as soon as possible and the commission should provide all the necessary technical assistance to the authorities of these two countries in order to meet the necessary conditions in a short while
