mr president i want to raise the case of mr john zafiropoulos who is in prison in greece
his family who are my constituents are convinced of his innocence
at the beginning of this year i wrote to the minister of justice in athens raising the case
i did not get a reply so in a one-minute speech here in may in this hemicycle i raised the question
immediately after i had spoken the greek permanent representation rushed to my office and promised me an immediate reply from the minister in person
four months later nothing
if the greek permanent representation is listening to us now in the hemicycle i would like to express my surprise and dismay that nothing has happened
would they please get me a reply from the minister and look at the case of mr john zafiropoulos again
