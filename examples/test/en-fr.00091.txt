madam president i want to thank and support the commission and the council for their work on ensuring adequate financing from the financial sector
there are however a couple of issues
we support introducing a form of coordinated stability level and a fund but when it comes to the financial transaction tax we are talking about an entirely different and much more complex issue
that tax as a minimum would have to be global to avoid tax evasion
furthermore a tax on all transactions might not only be technically infeasible but would also risk making the markets more volatile and less liquid
i have some questions on taxes
if the purpose is to generate money for global causes which money pots does the revenue go into and who has the responsibility for distributing the money
for a tax for a specific purpose when do we ever know when enough is enough
finally the key question is who will collect the tax the member states or the eu
if it is the eu far away from its citizens how do we prevent constant rising taxes
in the real world enough never seems to be enough when it comes to politicians need for additional money
