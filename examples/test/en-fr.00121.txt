madam president i should like to make this point to the vice-president of the commission high representative europe's foreign policy currently lacks leadership boldness and community method and this at a time when the union has more foreign policy instruments at its disposal than ever
you as you often say yourself are in listening mode listening to national governments and waiting until they have pronounced themselves
then you present the lowest common denominator and often at times when events have already moved on on syria for example what are you convinced of
should assad be included or not
what is your opinion
we would like to hear that
do you want to threaten sanctions or not
you ask us you did that in your reply to put pressure on governments so tell us which ones
open the debate
sure member states often lack the political will to act in a unified and decisive way and they do not want to see you strong but believe me baroness ashton they will not support you and will not save your life as high representative
they are not a guarantee for you to stay in your job i promise you
and also this does not change the fact that the lisbon treaty envisaged a stronger role for you
you are the rotating presidency
you are vice-president of the commission
you can take initiatives
you should set the agenda
you should set out in front your opinions your decisions and then let member states react
if you do not take initiatives at least do not kill those of others
for example the review of the g√∂teborg programme on conflict prevention ten years ago it was initiated by anna lindh
the hungarian presidency started a review and wanted you to take it over but you stopped it
i do not understand why
i can only recommend you dare more delegate more
follow margaret mead whom you cited
be the agent of change that we need
i promise you only this will save your position and nothing else
