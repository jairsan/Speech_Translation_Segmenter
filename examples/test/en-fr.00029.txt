madam president on monday evening the committee on foreign affairs adopted a motion regarding the deteriorating humanitarian situation in sri lanka pursuant to rule ninety-one
the situation in sri lanka is clearly very serious but exactly what is happening regarding the humanitarian situation is far from clear
i am conscious that there are many differing views across this house
so i suggest that the most sensible course of action would be to timetable a proper debate which cannot seriously be fitted in in this part-session but could be in our next part-session which is just ten days away
i am grateful to mr daul of the ppe-de group for indicating his group's support for this course of action
as we are a serious chamber i suggest and ask colleagues to support a debate with resolution and full participation at the next part-session to do justice to the gravity of the situation in sri lanka
