mr president as the situation in iran escalates and the violation of democracy also presents a danger to the stability of the whole region we have to express our concern and condemnation but declarations must not only be symbolic and empty
some european leaders are talking about new sanctions to be imposed on iran but a discussion is needed right now on the promotion of democracy at grass-root level in this country
i am polish and we in eastern europe know how important these types of actions are for the establishment of democracy
a promotion should be adapted to the political and economic situation in a given country but previous eu experience in the promotion of democracy in north africa the middle east and eastern europe has to be reviewed and evaluated in order to see what should be done in iran what can be done in iran and what is effective under given circumstances in this country
i also want to remind you that if the eu wants to be credible it also has to undertake some measures in moldova
soon we will face a new test on twenty-nine july with the elections in moldova
the eu has to do everything it can to ensure free and fair democratic elections in this country
it is not enough to talk about support for democracy we in the european parliament and european institutions have to be more active in that respect
