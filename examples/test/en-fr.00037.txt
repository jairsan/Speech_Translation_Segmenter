madam president this energy package is the culmination of years of hard work in which parliament can be very proud of the changes that will now be put in place
we should in particular be proud of the fact that the eu's energy consumers have now been put right at the centre of the energy debate for the first time and the issue of energy poverty has now been recognised at european level
the inherit conflict of interests that arises when a company owns both transmission and generation of electricity has been addressed and the regulatory regime governing the energy markets has been strengthened
the electricity directive for which i was rapporteur is part of a package of five measures which seeks improvements in the way the electricity and gas markets work across the continent to ensure that the markets are better integrated and operate in a fairer and less discriminatory way
let me say how grateful i have been for the enormous cooperation from the other rapporteurs on this package as well as from the shadows the commission and the czech presidency for helping us to come to a conclusion on what was sometimes a very challenging debate
the legislation has seen a raft of new consumer protection measures set out including ensuring that customers are able to switch suppliers within three weeks the provision in each member state of an independent and robust complaints system and the right to compensation if service levels are not met
this legislation will also ensure that every household in the eu will be fitted with so-called smart meters by twenty twenty-two
these smart meters will enable customers to better control their energy use and increase energy efficiency helping to cut energy costs and reduce carbon emissions
on the european parliament's initiative the new legislation also includes special protection measures for vulnerable energy consumers and the issue of energy poverty will now have to be taken seriously for the first time
i would like to ask commissioner piebalgs if he will now make a commitment that in future the energy framework of the eu in addition to addressing security of supply sustainability and competitiveness will also now add a fourth leg that of affordability to all future energy policy proposals
an eu-backed report has recently concluded that up to one hundred and twenty-five million citizens are affected by energy poverty
member states now must take appropriate measures which could lead to the prevention of hundreds if not thousands of deaths in the poorest households across the continent
we will also see the end to discriminatory pricing on prepayment meters
the most controversial part of the package centred on whether there was a need for full ownership unbundling in the energy markets in other words a total separation of transmission systems from generation
the market structure in some member states means that the monopoly enjoyed by transmission system operators who also own the means of generating electricity offers no incentive to encourage other players onto the market thereby undermining competition
parliament has now accepted a compromise that will allow ownership of both transmission and generation on condition that we see increased checks and balances to ensure the removal of the inherent conflict of interest that arises
many of us reluctantly accepted the compromise because we believe that the wind is blowing in the direction of wholesale separations and these integrated companies are likely to separate regardless of this directive
the commission's efforts in exposing the abuses of some companies is starting to pay off with examples of companies like e on and rwe agreeing to sell their transmission networks following anti-trust investigations
we are also going to see a strengthening of national regulatory authorities
i would like to thank everybody for their cooperation and i think we should be proud of what we have done for the consumers of the eu
