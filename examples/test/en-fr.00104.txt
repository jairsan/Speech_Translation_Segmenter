mr president may i ask the prime minister for his attention please
i am here on your left mr prime minister
i need to have a frank conversation with you
i have a text in portuguese but i am going to improvise in english because that was the language you used in what for me was the most important part of your speech when you said look at refugees
look at the refugees if you think that war and peace is not important for europe
you were addressing the new generations
i have to admit that my heart jumped when you said that because i am the european parliament rapporteur for refugees
during your presidency you could have done more than look at refugees
you could have done something to help it was not difficult
the council could have finished the codecision procedure which parliament started on resettlement of refugees
in our part of the codecision we increased the money that we give to member states to resettle refugees we established categories of priorities for people who have been raped who have been tortured and who have diseases and who are waiting in camps to be resettled
the council has not completed the codecision
it seems that it was because of article two hundred and ninety and delegated acts something which is in the treaty of lisbon
you say look at refugees
but i challenge you to do what we did go to the al-hol camp in syria
then tell refugees to look at article two hundred and ninety look at delegated acts
they will say what are you talking about
my kids are not going to school i do not have a passport we are stuck in a refugee camp why are you talking about a minor institutional problem when you could have done something to help our problem
this will tarnish the belgian presidency
i am sorry to say this i say it in sadness
