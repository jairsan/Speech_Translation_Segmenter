mr president i am one of those people who would like to ensure the continuity of internet freedom
the creators of the internet had great faith in the basic goodness of humankind and i tend to share that faith
unfortunately very often with the internet just as in any human society we have to face the sad fact that regulations are needed to make sure that those who cannot protect themselves are protected too
the safety of an individual is a fundamental right just as much as the right to free speech and to self-expression
abominations such as child pornography and paedophilia as well as internet fraud must be stopped
we cannot tolerate internet predators of any kind and while we are discussing this topic of great interest i would like to draw your attention to a much less discussed fact the internet is also full of sites that incite hatred violence and intolerance towards all kinds of minorities among them ethnic minorities
it is an aspect of the internet that needs our attention
we have to make sure that minorities also feel protected
it is unacceptable that many extremist groups use the internet to instigate hatred and xenophobia
