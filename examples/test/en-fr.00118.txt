madam president better and less expensive data transmission through high-speed broadband for all in twenty twenty that is an ambitious policy target i must say and i fully support it
but let us face it it will not come easily
nevertheless i believe that with the parliament's first-reading position we will be able to take a big first step towards this goal
and let us be clear broadband for all is not only about making sure that everyone has a facebook profile
it is about ensuring europe's place in the world as a leading knowledge-based economy
if we manage to connect five hundred million people our citizens and businesses will be able to reap all of the benefits and opportunities of the digital economy
two things especially need to change if europe is to get there
firstly we need a well-functioning pro-competition telecommunications market at european level
that is why we have introduced rules on competition-proofing
member states should not be allowed to allocate newly freed-up spectrum to a specific market player if that would diminish or distort competition in the market
secondly we need a more efficient allocation of spectrum an allocation that also more actively reflects today's diverse demands and needs for spectrum
that is why we are gearing this policy programme not only to free up the eight hundred mhz band but also to free up additional bands amounting to at least one two hundred mhz by twenty fifteen
let me finish by thanking the commission the commissioner the rapporteur and my fellow shadows for their extraordinarily good cooperation without it this level of ambition would not have been possible
