mr president i share in the delight of my friend and colleague ms gill that we are closing loopholes in this directive
timeshare is a big industry but it also can be a big scam
for example i have been dealing with a company called the european timeshare owners organisation which operates in spain but conveniently from an address in gibraltar and constituents have told me that they were approached by this company which offered to resell their timeshare
when they went to spain at great expense they found there was nobody to buy their timeshare but this company wanting to sell them other timeshares
i have been trying to get in touch with this company for several weeks and only finally this week managed to do so because miraculously the phone numbers they give do not have people at the other end to answer and they do not seem to respond to letters either
i hope that we will start now to crack down on organisations like the european timeshare owners organisation because they give timeshare a bad name and frankly they damage the image of the spanish holiday industry which i know you care so much about
