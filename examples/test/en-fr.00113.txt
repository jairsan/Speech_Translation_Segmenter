madam president we also welcome the successful conclusion of the second phase of the eu open skies agreement
indeed after several years it was rather overdue
obviously this agreement is a significant breakthrough and it is to be welcomed
i acknowledge that negotiators have made huge progress in the areas of security competition market access and environmental cooperation
but like the commissioner i am disappointed that this agreement did not achieve its ultimate objective of a complete opening of the market without restrictions on either side
the failure to resolve fully issues of foreign ownership and control cabotage must be addressed in future discussions if european carriers are to truly benefit
of course agreements mean compromise but that does not mean getting a deal at any price
the aviation industry is massively important to europe
it facilitates economic growth trade investment and tourism
air agreements with third countries offer our airlines great opportunities in foreign markets and i therefore urge the commission to continue to strive to conclude air agreements which are fair robust and lead to full liberalisation which will benefit both european carriers and consumers
finally can we just add our support to the eu-vietnam agreement
