madam president we are not simply discussing domestic problems in the european parliament
european values are being questioned in the new hungarian constitution
therefore we have to discuss it and have to do so now
there is still time before the adoption of the generic laws
i hope everyone agrees that the constitution has to be balanced close to the citizens based on generally accepted values and principles and should be party neutral
sadly the hungarian constitution does not fulfil these criteria
even the adoption of the document is questionable
there was no or very little social consultation
the text is only supported by one political party and it is opposed by major constitutional experts
the new constitution raises questions on an international level
for example there is a lack of reference to eu law in the closing provisions
we note clear differences and comparing the text to the charter of fundamental rights the text shows inconsistencies and differences in values and principles
the principle of good governance does not prevail in the document either
the constitution fails to provide an eu-conforming modern administrative structure
the aforementioned generic laws are very dangerous
they make governing the country almost impossible for any future government
we have the impression as one of our colleagues has put it that the government is like a football team trying to change the rules and the referee during a game
this is not the way to treat political opponents and this is certainly not how democracy works in the twenty-first century in europe
