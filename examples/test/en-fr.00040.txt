madam president i am glad that in the end common sense has prevailed in parliament and the commission concerning the causes of this financial crisis
people have realised that this crisis is not of a cyclical nature and that a thorough overhaul of the regulation and supervision of financial markets is badly needed
the de larosi√®re group report and the turner report too have made this quite clear
these reports are in analytical tune with the lamfalussy follow-up report of parliament
the documents which are being debated today are to be seen in the same logic of action
unfortunately our economies will still suffer for quite a while not least because of the public budgets and probably future inflationary facts of the efforts which are being undertaken to clean up the huge mess
let us hope that we will learn more this time than we have from previous episodes of crisis
