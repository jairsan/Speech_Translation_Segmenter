i hope that you appreciate the fact that i allowed you to speak although what you raised was not really a point of order
my job is not to monitor what members decide to say
my job is to ensure that they say it when they have the time to say it as opposed to interrupting each other and doing so i might add in a rather rude and loud way
so thank you for your comment
i will insist when i chair at least that members conduct themselves in a civil way with each other and i will try to keep the time as best i can
what members say in the room in a democratic room such as this is their business not mine
