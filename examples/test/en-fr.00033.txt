madam president i speak on the van nistelrooij report and to emphasise three points
first that territorial cohesion involves promoting polycentric development across the european union
this means eliminating disparities within as well as between regions
there is consequently a need for improved spatial analysis and the development of indicators against which policies can be designed and their impact assessed
second there must be an integrated approach with measurement in advance of the effect that sectoral policies would have at regional levels and the achievement of greater synergy between them
certainly such impact assessment could pre-empt certain problems such as those posed by the electronic identification of sheep in scotland
third an integrated approach demands proper multilevel governance involving all stakeholders in the design and implementation of strategies
what the commissioner has said in these respects has been very welcome and i hope for great support for this excellent report
