mr president a simple letter from the council that the negotiation guidelines will fully contain parliament's concerns that negotiations will begin immediately with the united states and not at some point in the future and that parliament will be fully involved in these negotiations might have sufficed and it would not be that difficult to give in order to alleviate this parliament's concerns about the way it has been treated ignored and played with in the past
but you could not do even this today
the bulk transfer of data the commissioner said is not a problem
only some data will go there
swift tells us that is not the case
the united states administration tells us that is not the case
there is no proof of what you say in this statement
you mentioned the negotiating guidelines that you are nearly done with
where are they
given the pressure that exists today why can you not tell us exactly where you agree and where you disagree with parliament instead of making general statements
i feel it is extremely important to fight together with the united states against terrorism
i urge the united states and council to work very seriously together with us after our vote tomorrow and not to choose bilateral routes or dream about breaking the solidarity but to work together to protect fundamental rights while we protect security
