madam president i welcome the commission green paper and its objective of increasing the visibility of the issues around the eu health workforce and identifying challenges and action that can be taken
however i wish to take the opportunity to emphasise one aspect of the green paper namely the training of the health workforce
i initiated written declaration ninety-five two thousand and eight on this issue which is ongoing
i strongly support the idea that it is absolutely essential to develop training communication courses for the health workforce in order to provide clearer and more complete information to patients
patients ability to understand health and medical issues and directions is closely related to the clarity of the communication
despite various initiatives to improve the quality and the availability of health information studies indicate that patients want more information than they currently receive and that health professionals tend to overestimate the amount of information that is supplied
