madam president this final proposal on seal hunting is wholly unacceptable as it grossly interferes with other countries affairs
yet these countries play by the rules and all they are trying to achieve is to manage natural resources and provide employment for their people
this proposal destroys people's lives and their communities in remote regions
it destroys business opportunities on both sides of the atlantic and seriously harms good relations with important trade and strategic global partners
furthermore this proposal violates wto rules
as members of parliament we have a duty to protect people and create an environment for employment opportunities
with this ban we are failing in both areas
slapping a ban on overpopulated seals is madness and a complete failure of our values
i say to all meps please stop this disaster and vote against this proposal
