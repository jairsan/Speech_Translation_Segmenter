mr president before the entry into force of the lisbon treaty the three proposals in question were based on articles sixty three hundred and one and three hundred and eight of the treaty establishing the european community
this is now only of historical interest since the legal basis has changed and we have to refer to articles two hundred and fifteen and seventy-five of the new treaty
incredible as it might seem the lisbon treaty limited the role of the european parliament in this particular case
article two hundred and fifteen clearly states that the council only has to inform the european parliament on the measures adopted as opposed to the former procedure that implied the consultation of parliament on such matters
i cannot accept that and i strongly support my colleagues initiative to clarify parliament's involvement in this area
leaving aside the legal aspect that i hope will be solved through good cooperation between the european institutions i would like to draw your attention to the important problem that we are debating here which is fighting terrorism and terrorism-related activities such as the ones carried out by osama bin laden and the al-qaeda network
i think that when it comes to such sensitive topics we cannot afford to classify them into strict categories such as eu-internal and eu-external issues because terrorist actions might be planned outside the eu but can seriously affect the people living inside the eu
we have the responsibility to protect these european citizens against terrorist action so we have to be given the tools to do that
i trust your good judgment in solving this procedural problem and i am looking forward to hearing the opinion of the representatives of the council and the commission
