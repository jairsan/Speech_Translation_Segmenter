mr president the majority of europeans are not corporate leaders and not bankers but family farmers small entrepreneurs state employees
the majority of europe is completely fed up with the present system in which global multinational corporations and banks rule the world
they need and they want a fundamentally new paradigm in which there must be a shift from globalisation to localisation from completely profit- and money-centred decision making to human-centred and community-centred decision making from wto-ruled free trade agriculture to food sovereignty local production and local farming
please do not fail to represent at the g twenty summit the views of the majority of europe
