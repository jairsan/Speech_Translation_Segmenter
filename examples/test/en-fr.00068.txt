mr president i think it is clear to all of us here that the iranian regime is a dictatorial and criminal regime
the question is how to deal with it
i would like to state very clearly my support for the delegation that would have gone to iran from this parliament
the delegation would have met for one whole day members of the opposition and dissidents
it would have strengthened them
they wanted that
so i really feel very sorry that this delegation visit could not take place
i have one very concrete question to you baroness ashton
several members here have talked about sanctions
from the experience i have as a member of the national parliament and talking with many people for a long time i would really be in favour of smart sanctions targeted for example at specific members of the revolutionary guard putting them on a veto list for visits or at other specific persons
i am very much against imposing sanctions on the whole country as that would probably strengthen the government because then poverty would increase they would not have access for example to petrol and that would help to support the regime instead of weakening it
