mr president we need to push for a maximum of transparency and accountability on the budget as this will contribute highly to the legitimacy of the eu's external policy
we are talking about significant sums spent on the basis of regulations which leave a considerable margin of manoeuvre for the commission
this is all right but we need to exert our full scrutiny on strategy papers multiannual indicative programmes and the like as they are of a general scope and supplement the financial instruments by defining priority areas and objectives
the commission should show its result in an annual report to parliament with particular attention to the oda eligibility of all projects
programming and planning should be carried out by the same expert people who are doing this now but the external action service itself needs more development and human rights experts to understand and work with these instruments in brussels and in eu delegations in third countries
