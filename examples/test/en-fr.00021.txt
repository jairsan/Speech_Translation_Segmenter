madam president i am glad to see mr vondra back
i thank him for explaining the gravity of the situation but when is the council going to learn that until the eu speaks with one voice on energy issues in particular in relation to russia and the ukraine we are going to be in a weak position
i am going to give you an example where the council does not do that
we shall shortly be starting negotiations on the second reading of the energy liberalisation package
the commission came up with a very carefully crafted position on third countries investing in the eu suggesting that the commission speak on behalf of the eu on these issues
what have you in the council done
you have retreated to national positions and said no we member states we want the final say not the commission
it is this divide-and-rule the oldest trick in the book which you and your fellow colleagues have fallen for
until you understand that pooling your powers to gain more leverage internationally is the way to go we will always be in a position where we are vulnerable
you must answer the european citizens as to why they are now sitting in the cold
you have to change your position on this line
will you do so
