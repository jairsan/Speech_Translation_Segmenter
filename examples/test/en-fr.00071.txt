mr president this amendment refers to the fact that the government in skopje has come forward with a draft anti-discrimination law deleting sexual orientation from that whole package
that is simply unacceptable but i do not want to give anybody the option to vote against this amendment on human rights because of the name issue with the former yugoslav republic of macedonia so i ask to change macedonian government to government of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia
