mr president i hate to have to prolong this further
what you said in your instructions was that people could either vote in favour or abstain
the final results show however in favour abstentions and against
i understand that there may be many people who would have voted differently if they had known they had the choice of the three
what i would like to ask is if indeed this is the correct way to do it to do it one last time
