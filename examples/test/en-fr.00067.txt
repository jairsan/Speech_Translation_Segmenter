mr president let us not allow fear to guide us we often say
some people question whether our airport security measures are too tight
well the detroit terror attempt made us realise that our security systems are not excessively tight but are still rather unsatisfactory
as you all know the slovakian secret service placed plastic explosives in the bag of a slovakian citizen
the passenger as well as the bag got on board without any problems and landed in ireland
no doubt the test was spectacular but certainly it did not strengthen the belief of citizens that security on the one hand and the right to privacy on the other hand are taken seriously by the authorities
citizens are flooded with conflicting information and misinterpretations in the press on a daily basis
after detroit to give you an example the spotlight is on body scanners as the best solution
