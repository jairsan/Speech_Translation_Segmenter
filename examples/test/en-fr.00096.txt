madam president i ask my colleagues to vote against the postponement
we must speak out before the elections so it must be now
it is an issue about fair elections in a european country and that cannot be a partisan issue
last time in two thousand and four we could only speak out after the falsified elections and we were united
this time there is ample evidence beforehand of security service interference and a massive practice of non-admittance or of fake local party lists to confuse voters
so let us be united again for the sake of democracy
i think the massive lobbying of the ukrainian embassies throughout europe towards us to prevent this resolution is proof of how right we are to speak out now
