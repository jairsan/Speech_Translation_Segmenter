madam president the resolution on the situation in belarus reveals what brussels and minsk could do in order not to lose the momentum for improving their relations
i support the approach taken by jan marinus wiersma which also mirrors the stance taken by the belarusian opposition of alexander v kazulin and alexander milinkevich
the policy of the eu to punish belarus and the belarusians for the actions of their regime did not achieve the envisaged results
it is necessary to open all gates for people-to-people contacts and bring down visa barriers which are contradictory to common sense
providing minsk is really willing to improve cooperation with the eu this should create more favourable conditions for the kick-off of mutual discussions not only externally but also domestically
it can be done by starting talks on the political economic social and human rights issues involving all political parties opposition forces ngos and trade unions
