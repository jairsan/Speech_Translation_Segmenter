mr president i would just like to comment on the third point of the oral question this evening on airline bankruptcy
a recent resolution in this house called for the establishment of a guarantee fund that would be used to compensate passengers in case of airline bankruptcy
however the establishment of such a fund would inevitably have to be funded by the consumer meaning passengers would be required to pay even more for their tickets
at this stage this is an unnecessary step and would add to the sizeable list of existing airport taxes security charges and other duties that they are already forced to pay
in addition the commission should ensure that the national aviation authorities and regulators uphold existing obligations such as regularly carrying out financial status checks of airlines and exercising their right to revoke airline operating licences before liquidation occurs
we ask the commission to vigorously pursue this course of action now
finally i would call on the commission to pursue other options which could protect passengers in this regard including the provision of obligatory information regarding risk insurance options and other protective mechanisms
