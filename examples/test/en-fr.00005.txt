sometimes a question flies away and this is perhaps a bit obsolete i must admit but i thank the commission for giving such a fair answer
my appeal and my worry is that we are over-reacting and i hope the commission could consider that
i agree that we should act and react but we should not overdo it because we need a balanced approach
otherwise and i think that is something we should consider in the long term we could harm growth in europe
so i think a balanced approach and i rely on the commission to ensure these measures are implemented in an appropriate way
