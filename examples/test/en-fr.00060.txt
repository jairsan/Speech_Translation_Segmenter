madam president i congratulate and thank my colleague alexander alvaro for his work and for the good cooperation we had during the drafting of this report
it was a report where i agreed with the rapporteur on the main points namely that access to the data entered into the customs information system is to be ensured only to specifically designated bodies and staff like the member states europol and eurojust
another point which was raised in one of my amendments and supported by the rapporteur refers to the fact that member states europol and eurojust are not granted the possibility to communicate data to non-member states and third countries because of the absence of sufficient data protection in those countries
in my opinion the review of the customs information system as reflected by the report is necessary in order to adapt it better to the control services requirements and to allow a limited number of users to carry out analyses of the information contained in the system
the review will also increase the effectiveness of the cooperation and control procedures of the customs administrations due to the joint automated information system which will assist in preventing investigating and prosecuting serious contraventions of national laws
