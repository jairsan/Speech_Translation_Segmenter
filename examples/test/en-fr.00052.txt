mr president so far the g twenty has concentrated on measures for the financial sector
however everyone seems to forget that the real economy also suffers from greed and an obsession with short-term profits
i have deep respect for small enterprises which against all odds try to survive
they deserve to get the loans to which they are entitled
however i have no respect at all for the management of some of the bigger companies which have no affinity with the products or services they deliver and can only think in terms of expansion and speculation
i therefore call upon the g twenty to discuss ways of making the economy more democratic and how to make sure that within the company workers and others who represent the general interest have enough power to control the management
within the eu we have to look again at the statute for a european company
we should make sure that it becomes impossible for shareholders and management to engage in speculative growth strategies to the detriment of the long-term interest of the companies themselves and of those who work for these companies
