mr president i just want to say that my voting machine did not work for the vote on the european protection order but i would have voted in favour because this is a very important issue and it was important for parliament to adopt the european protection order today
this legislation is essential for europe
the mutual recognition of judgment and judicial decisions is fundamental in an area of freedom security and justice
in order to prevent a crime or a new crime being committed against a protected person the executing state is now given a legal base for recognising a decision previously adopted in another member state
this legislation is needed for the prevention of violence against women and the other victims of violence
it is an essential and important step in enabling victims to reside or stay wherever they want in the eu and thereby be included in the freedom of movement
