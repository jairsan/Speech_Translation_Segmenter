mr president i rise on mr hoppenstedt's report to give the budget committee's opinion
like mr hoppenstedt this will be my last speech before this chamber after twenty years
the budget committee recognises the importance of these proposals and their urgency
it is quite clear that some key eu policies will be undermined without proper financing and therefore we are happy to support the proposal
however we would point that this money is coming from the margin of heading one a so that will reduce the margin and therefore reduce the availability of funding for other projects which may be important in the future
we should bear that in mind
secondly we should also ensure that these organisations do not in any way become agencies because if they did they would of course be subject to the interinstitutional agreement on agencies
finally we would not want the budget committee's position to be in any way undermined by the rush for these proposals
that is why the budget committee was happy to support mr mccreevy's proposal on monday night about interim funding so that we can ensure that proper financial procedures and a proper trialogue takes place on the financial implication of these proposals
