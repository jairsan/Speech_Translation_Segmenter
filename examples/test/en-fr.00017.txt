mr president the gas crisis has left hundreds of thousands of households across seventeen european countries without heating during freezing temperatures
eastern and central europe have been affected the most by the dispute which has shut down factories and schools
even if kiev and moscow sign the eu-brokered deal after hours of talks with eu officials gazprom says that the deal to restart gas supplies to europe via ukraine will be delayed as it has not received a copy of the agreement
the team of technical experts sent by the european commission will check flows into ukrainian pipelines from russia and even if the gas starts to flow in ukraine it may take about thirty-six hours to reach eu member states
as a result europe needs a single policy on energy security in order to avoid future conflicts and it needs to diversity its sources of energy supplies
i welcome the intervention of parliament in the dispute and hope that an agreement will be reached as soon as possible in order to avoid a deepening conflict
