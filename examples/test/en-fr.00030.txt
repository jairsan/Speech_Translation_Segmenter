mr president i would like to speak about a very important issue related to the european prize for literature
the prize is financed by the cultural programme of the european union and it aims to put the spotlight on creativity in the field of contemporary fiction
i think it is a very good initiative but i have my concerns about its implementation
i have been contacted by cultural organisations from my country that are unhappy because romania is not included this year in the programme
indeed out of thirty-four eligible countries only twelve are included each year in this programme
the legitimate question is how the remaining countries including romania could take an active part if they are not included at all in the programme
so i would like to bring this problem to your attention and i hope we will find together with the european commission a convenient way to settle this problem
