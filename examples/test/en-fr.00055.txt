mr president energy security is for us to a large extent a question of energy independence as many have said and as mr piebalgs said correctly the most effective strategy is that of efficiency savings and renewables
but we as greens are also realistic and realise that in the medium term we will need gas supplies
therefore we are in favour of diversification and also see the nabucco project as a european priority project
but let me say why we do not believe that a nuclear strategy is a strategy of independence certainly not of energy independence
after all uranium is imported and not only from countries we like
and if we speak about security we have to mention the security implications of nuclear energy namely nuclear proliferation and we see the problems that we have with that in other very high-profile security issues
we cannot neglect that and we cannot say that nuclear energy is completely separate from the question of nuclear proliferation
in addition our group strongly believes that all projects have to address concerns about transparency and corruption and cannot stand in the way of a frank and strict human rights dialogue with the cooperation countries as well as a holistic and political approach to these countries
